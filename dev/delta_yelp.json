They do not care about you as passengers. They will not even respond to you.This is my complaint to them:\" We are absolutely furious at the fact you would plan flights when SFO was having construction in the runway. Our flight was Delayed for 5 hours and we had to change our flight to San jose which was a 40 min lyft drive for us !!! To top it all off, our seats were not provided to us until the last hour of our flight in San jose WHICH WAS DELAYED AN HOUR AS WELL TOO. Customer service gave us no remorse of sympathy , no sorry or voucher was provided to the wasted time that was given to us. We ended up missing work the next day because of this incident. Delta was our go to flight but after this incident, we don't think we can trust Delta anymore.

DELTA customer service phone line representative alongside with Supervisor took care of the roundtrip reservation except that they failed to complete the return attachment. Leaving me to pay almost $615.00 extra because of their mistake On the return flight for my kids so I had to take care of the tickets at the airport on the spot or my kids were going to be left stranded in NYC. I called Delta Corporate line and they cleaned their hands giving me the poor excuse that they can't give me a refund on the 3rd ticket I had to pay to return back home because my kids flew in it, I had 24 hours to make any changes and I purchase a non-refundable ticket. Why if it's not my fault that DELTA didn't attach the return I have to be responsible to pay for 2 extra return flights plus an extra almost $615.00. When you call the company it says all phone calls are recorded for quality service, but they also fail to retrieve the phone call from that day to understand that it was their mistake and legally they have to refund the money. What is the purpose of recording the phone calls if the quality of service is always going to be poorly handled.

I used to fly to Holland with a stop in the middle, but those days are over as there is one direct flight a day on Delta and is so much easier!! The flight is also way shorter than if you had to stop in NYC or Atlanta because you end up flying so high north (above Greenland). Greeted by champagne or a mimosa is always a nice touch. The 2019 summer menu included beef meatballs with ricotta cheeses, build your own hamburgers, steak, caprese salads with butternut squash soup. Desserts included build your own ice cream sundae, brownie or raspberry macaroon tart. Delta TUMI care kits have been similar over the last few years...I believe they used to have DELTA slippers you could use for the bathrooms, but I did not receive any on this flight. The highlight of this long flight were the recline-able chairs that have a sleep option that allows you to lay completely flat like a bed, fitted with a comfortable pillow and blanket. Their touch screen TV's allow you to watch a lot of different movies, shows, etc....no more using a remote control. They offer noise cancelling headphones that look nice, but always bring my own. Would definitely recommend using Delta One for any long haul of a flight. Only thing I noticed was that on a Jet Blue Mint Flight (first class) they had a door you could close so it felt more like a private chair/cubicle...on this flight they did not have a door, but perhaps on other Delta One flights they do.

I had booked a flight from LGA to MCO on vacation, and the same return flight a week later.Going down to MCO wasnt necessarily the smoothest process, as there was not enough overhead compartments on the plane to accommodate all of the carryon items the passengers had forcing most of the main cabin to check their carryons for retrieval later.Coming back to LGA was a complete and utter nightmare. The flight scheduled to depart at 3:41PM was delayed at first by only a few minutes. Those few minutes turned into thirty, which later turned into hours due to short inclement weather that lasted less than 30 minutes around the destination airport. Ultimately that flight ended up getting canceled completely after being delayed over 4 hours, and it seemed that 'Delta' was doing a favor to its customers saying that the flight was not only cancelled due to the weather but also due to the crew being late. First off, I do not know how delta airlines does not have an alternate crew on standby which would have alleviated this great delay.Second off, I was luckily able to switch my flight to JFK an airport roughly 30 minutes from LGA at around 6 pm. This flight had also been delayed due to the weather but not canceled. This blew my mind why delta would decide to completely cancel their flight to LGA when they were still serving their JFK flight. I had gotten tickets on that JFK flight that was intended to board at 7pm. That later turned cluster to 8pm. I had kept asking if my baggage will be transferred multiple times from the LGA flight to the JFK flight as there was an ample amount of time. I kept being reassured that it would be. Boarding the flight I asked the flight attendant if the baggage is on the plane, they called the baggage office and clearly it was not. They had said it would cause an imbalance of the plane, which was a full flight but nobody from the LGA flight who transferred over had rigeur bags. Upon landing I immediately went to baggage services to file a claim. I was advised by the ma'am working there that the bag would be delivered to my door in 24 hours. That clearly is not the case as I was now advised that it wouldn't be delivered until the following day. I called baggage services to only be on hold for over an hour with no better answer of an estimated time of delivery for my bag.I then proceeded to call corporate to explain my situation, due to the inconvenience I was offered a $100 voucher that I was not told had to be used Within 1 Year of it being issued or it would expire worthless. This entire experience with delta has been nothing but a complete hassle I have flown other airlines for both business and pleasure and never had any issues. I had thought to give delta a chance, and boy was that a huge mistake. It shows the disconnect between employees and ultimately not serving the customer to satisfaction standards, while also offering empty promises that they cannot hold up their end of the bargain.

I called for a flight attendant to address this issue, and he said he was aware of it. He mentioned getting us blankets but they ran out, so the next best thing he can do is run it by the pilot. About 15 minutes later, the temp was much better. He could have left it at that, but nope... he came by to check on us again to make sure we were doing okay. Talk about great customer service! As previously mentioned, our return flight wasn't at capacity, so there were rows and rows of open seats. Many asked if we could occupy them.

At times, flights are overbooked and passengers are bumped off. That happened to us with another airline but not so with Delta. The flight left as scheduled and the staff was very professional and made our entire flight from check in to boarding to landing extremely enjoyable. The flights from LAX to Leon are usually flown on a smaller commuter jet such as an EMB-135 or CRJ-200. Those planes are tiny and you really have to duck your head to get inside the cabin during boarding. Overhead bins are smaller yet the seats are comfortable. Our flight was smooth and the take off during the middle of the night gave us a breathtaking view of Los Angeles as well as Leon when we landed. Most of the passengers were fast asleep after take off and the crew dimmed the lights as soon as we departed so we could relax.Sadly, Delta ended it's service from LAX to Leon.

We purchased the economy plus tickets (it was sold under another title, I believe, but it's kind of a bump up from economy, with a bit of legroom). The in-flight movies/TV/music/entertainment were plentiful, and they offered free-to-keep ear buds. Tiny TV screens resided in the back of each headrest, with touch-screen capability. What really stole the show?....1.) Randy & Iyvolo. I know I'm probably spelling that wrong, but I've provided the flight number in this review for a reason: These guys kicked SO much ass, it was ridiculous. The entire flight, they were full of positive energy (I know that sounds yoga-level lame, but...) and smiles. They really transformed me into a Delta fan. 2.) The captain's announcements were hilarious; particularly the part about him being \"full-blooded German\" and always wanting to be on time. He had the cabin laughing. 3.) FREE SNACKS!!! Whaaaaaaat? Yes, cookies (including my beloved Oreos), pretzels, twix bars, nuts, chips, granola bars... I mean, this was ridiculous.4.) The class I was sitting in got FREE booze! It wasn't an international flight, but it didn't matter: FREE BOOZE. Dude. It doesn't matter what time of day I'm flying; I'm taking advantage of this service.Look, I know flying sucks, these days.

What fresh sweet hell does thou hath put upon me? In all of my years of traveling, I have never experienced the insanity that I experienced on both of my flights coming and going from OAK to LAX.I went to Los Angeles, flying out of Oakland, for the weekend on 6/23 with a returning ticket on 6/25. Both of my flights coming and going were delayed due to \"technical/mechanical\" issues, which is like...mathematically implausible. My flight to LAX was supposed to leave around 10AM and I received a text an hour before stating it was pushed back to 12:31PM then 2:29PM then 3:36PM then 5:00PM. I could have driven to Los Angeles in that amount of time and don't think I didn't consider it. But, when I arrived to Los Angeles everything else had went according to plan (better) and I mellowed out.However, the return was the worse. That flight was supposed to depart at 4:20PM. Received a text at 4:21PM that it was pushed back to 5:30PM then 6:17PM then 9:01PM. At 8PM they said the 9PM flight was cancelled and they rebooked another plane, at another gate to fly to OAK at 10PM. They put us on the plane, which there was no pilot, they said they \"couldn't find the pilot,\" to which they DEPLANED us. At this point loads of us shafted passengers were forming a \"let's get a van and drive to the bay area\" plan. People were losing their shit. Finally...they found a pilot (and a co-pilot) and replaned us, said it was only gonna take 55mins (instead of the 1hour and 45mins) and I finally walked through my door at midnight.Meanwhile, this is not just as cut and dry. Every time they delayed a flight, people scurried like rats to find alternative flights out to Oakland or nearby (hell, someone even flew out to SAC). And when they would restructure the flight from a different gate, people would scurry to get back on the flight. It was like total insanity. It was like the plane version of the f'ing Darjeeling Limited! Because who wants to stay overnight in the airport and fly out god knows when...when the flight itself is only an hour! What has sat in my mind the most though...out of all that bullshivit...there was an elder passenger. He was in a suit, tie, tall and stoic. He was in a good and zen mood for most of it. But, by time we landed in OAK an airport assistant had to push him through the terminal in a wheelchair. He was so exhausted. It just made me crumble. I kept thinking I would have loved to take my mom on this trip, but if she would have had to gone through this hell and ended up like that elder man...I would have gone completely ballistic.

You can probably guess what happened already.We arrive at the airport and Delta gives us boarding passes that are not the seats that I booked. In fact, my wife and daughter are together, but I am by myself. I asked how this could be, and the agent said that she had no idea, and that Delta does not change seating assignments. I said that Delta did change the seating, and she said no. And back and forth and back and forth and finally we said whatever, maybe someone on the plane will switch with us and if not, at least two are together and we can trade seats throughout.No one would switch with us, but we made due, even though it wasn't an ideal start to a family vacation when one family member was isolated from the others.Fast forward one week. We had the best vacation. Relaxation. Togetherness. We were ready for our flight together home before getting back to our regular lives. We show up to the airport and find that all three of our seats have changed, and none of us were together. How did this happen? The only response was that Delta doesn't change seat assignments. So how did my seat assignments change? They had no answer.So we get to the plane, assuming that we would have help from the crew to put us back together, because THERE'S NO WAY THAT THEY WOULD ALLOW A 5-YEAR-OLD TO FLY AWAY FROM FAMILY, RIGHT? The crew's response? We can't make anyone move. They paid for these seats.What?What if my daughter was 2 and sat in her own seat. Would she be required to fly in an airplane away from her parents? The answer was yes. These are the seats that were paid for. But those were not the seats I paid for!Were any passengers willing to move?

We had to be a work the next day not in an airport and they did not care. The email stated they had double booked, the customer service agent stated it was because they had to use a smaller airplane and there was nothing Delta could do. One or the other were lies. Either it was double booked or they used a smaller airplane NOT BOTH. DELTA IS FULL OF LIARS!!! The truth was there was nothing Delta was willing to do except steal our money. This is FAR from the first time Delta has done exactly this as it can be found on the review sites repeatedly. The airline does not care one bit about their customers. We were told we could either not fly Delta and they would keep our money or we could accept a lesser seat than what we paid for and they would still keep our money.

After 1.5 hours of this, the wifey asked what the issue was and Ana T. responded with \"Like I have already told you many times before, you need a visa to go to Grenada.\" Super rude. They finally printed her boarding pass and told her that she was going at her own risk. She was able to go through Grenada's immigration with no issues and confirmed with immigration there that a visa was not needed. Oh and she had a layover in JFK and they made her pick up her luggage in JFK rather than have it be picked up directly in her destination.

On the outgoing flight we had seats 23 A, B, C & D. On the return we had 21H,J,K & L. The prices ended up going down a few weeks after I booked, so I obviously booked a little early. I didn't care though because we had great seats. At the time I booked, most of the plane seats were available. I checked on our reservations a few days weeks before the flight to see that we had no seats assigned anymore. I tried assigning new seats but nothing would save. I called Delta. They tried to book seats for over an hour, but could not. They finally told me to call Alitalia because only they could do it. I did. Alitalia tried for over an hour, but said because it was \"provided in code share,\" they could not assign my seats, only Delta could. I called Delta again. We were on the phone over an hour with her trying to assign the seats. She finally said there was a new system and for some reason, it would not let the seats be assigned. She admitted there was something wrong with the system. She said I would have to wait until I got to the airport to see if they could assign seats then. She acknowledged that at that time, we would get whatever seats were leftover. I understand that seats are not guaranteed, however, Delta made a big deal of providing Delta Basic Economy Fares in which you would not be able to book a seat until check-in. These were not those fares! I booked so early to ensure seats together in the front rows. Now we are at the mercy of whatever is left for a 13+ hour flight. My girls are nervous when flying as it is. This was not a matter of us being reassigned for some reason, there system had a glitch that would not allow the seats to be saved.We ended up with two 13 hour flights in seats that were randomly assigned at check-in, all the way in the back of the plane next to the noisy meal preparation area and bad smelling restrooms. Our young daughters were seated next to strangers. We were not treated well, or fairly as customers who expected more from our booking airline!

Unsatisfied patrons should be refunded monies at a minimum for additional service purchases that are misleading in nature.-Safety concerns- while many might think they are doing a good job.

My luggage took around 10-minutes after disembarking to arrive at baggage claim, which was pretty fast in my opinion. My favorite part of the experience though at LAX with Delta was checking-in since I was flying business class on a few flights. Since some of the flights out of LAX are categorized as Delta One, it seems Delta has been focusing on improving the experience for Sky Priority passengers at LAX. The Sky Priority check-in has it's own counter area and entrance away from all the regular check-in counters, which makes it much quieter and easier to navigate. Additionally the check-in area has it's own escalator up to TSA so you pretty much avoid the mass of travelers trying to get to security.

Following the rough landing onto the runway of LAX, we arrived at our gate and the seat belt sign was turned off. All passengers began standing up and gathering our things but I didn't necessarily see anyone leaving the plane. 10 minutes went by and still no announcement as to what was happening and when we would be let off the plane. Finally after 19 minutes of no communication whatsoever we were told there was a problem with the connector of the sky tunnel and the plane. Another 10 minutes later (now 29 minutes after landing!) we were told that there was no progress with fixing whatever needed to be fixed and that they would \"maybe\" be bringing in the stairs for us to walk down. This whole \"maybe\" was upsetting to me and the passengers around me as we were all trying to catch connecting flights and our travel plans could be completely jeopardized. Finally, at 7:55 the doors were opened and we began being let off the plane. At this point, all our flights had already boarded and one gentleman next to me had already missed his flight to SFO. The experience as a whole was unfortunate but some things are uncontrollable such as the issues with the connector of the sky tunnel, however many things are controllable such as the communication to passengers stuck on a plane at 7 am who could be missing their next flight.As a result of this delay, I was late to my flight and I was unable to stow my carryon in the overhead compartments as they were all already full.

I believe most travelers are used to the boarding protocol of \"zones\" listed on our passes so the announcement of \"boarding by rows\" was definitely different than usual and unfortunately, it was not heard by all passengers. As such, mass confusion ensued and everyone congregated in a large pile outside of the gate wondering who was permitted to board. I watched as various individuals that had seats between the rows of 22-38 be turned away as soon as they reached the woman who was scanning their boarding passes - she stated that they were NOT boarding their rows at this particular moment which was the complete opposite of the announcement that was previously made. After many minutes of waiting, another boarding announcement was made that they were now boarding \"Sky Priority\" members and in turn, the individuals in rows 22-38 were still left waiting even though our boarding was called first. Some time passed and the woman in the front finally began announcing the board process by zones. While I understand that things can get hectic, I don't quite understand why they made TWO different announcements in regard to boarding and if it was indeed an error on their part, why they didn't clarify their omission so that all passengers could avoid waiting an extra 20 minutes in complete confusion. With that said, when I finally was able to get up to the front of the line the female representative (same woman making the announcements and such) stated that I needed to have my bag checked as it was too large...Interestingly enough, this is the same carry on luggage I take with me on any other trip and airline and have absolutely zeroes issues with. \u00a0With that said, while my mobile boarding pass was scanned, the system kept returning with an error. My husband's boarding pass scanned just fine (or at least we think it did since the rep was more than happy to let him board) before me and we are both under the same confirmation number. The Delta representative handed my mobile boarding pass to another representative who took a look into my account and stated, \"they didn't even check in\". Actually, we did check in the previous day on hence why I have screenshots of my mobile boarding passes and seat numbers so I'm not sure why it stated otherwise. Eventually the other representative handed my husband and I new print out boarding passes and said we were good to go.When we finally reached our rows as stated on our mobile boarding pass, it appeared that my seat as well as my husband's seat was taken by other passengers who had the same exact seat listed on their passes. My husband takes a look at the new boarding passes the representative had printed us and it appears that our seats were changed without any notification to us. What is the point of selecting my seats a week in advance if Delta isn't going to honor these choices and will switch our seats without any previous notification? This is incredibly inconvenient to passengers. Lastly, once our flight took off, I happened to miss the drink cart as it came by so I decided to ask the flight attendant for a drink of water while I was in line waiting to use the bathroom. Instead of being met with a courteous demeanor and perhaps eye contact, the flight attendant was focused on typing/texting something on her phone. I had to say \"Excuse me\" twice before she looked up at me with such disdain, as if my request was a complete inconvenience to her day. Being a first-time Delta customer, I am not impressed at all with any of the services rendered by Delta Airlines during this trip and it has wholly ruined our view of this airline."}, {"count": 801, "date": "3/29/2017", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "review": "Delay Delay Delay**Delayed flight departing!!Luggage delayed upon arrival when it was on the same plan as my family how is that possible?!

For the most part, the planes are decently comfortable. I mean comfortable by airplane standards. There isn't a ton of leg room. ALSO this last flight I was on was really full and there was no room for people to put bags above, and due to this I had to have my bag under the seat. Which is fine.. but really limited leg room. I would have appreciated an option of putting it above, especially because it was just a small bag. They give a decent drink selection, with a couple of little snacks... which I think they could amp up a bit, but oh well. You can buy things (with credit/debit card only) to eat, but it is a limited selection. On longer flights that include meals... yeah honestly they are bad. Depending where you are flying to/out of .. it can be better or worse. But I never feel good after eating the food and try to avoid it when I can.

We were scheduled 2 arrive in FL by 7 a.m. EST early this morning... smh2 our surprise, not only did our flight 2LAX get delayed by about an hour, but according 2the ticket kiosk we weren't going 2even make it 2our connecting flight since the 1st flight was scheduled 2 LAND @10:47 pm, 10 minutes AFTER the 2nd flight was 2 TAKE OFF. The available connecting flights departing from LAX were on the following DAY, around 6 am EARLIEST!We left the kiosk &went straight2 guest special services, &the teller there proceeded 2state2 us that the delay was really just a precaution &we shouldn't worry about missing our2nd flight. Based on...??We asked why weren't we notified on even the DELTA app (which was always prompt when it came to flight updates) &he stated that delays were a CONSTANT exaggeration by their co. &we shouldn't worry. Oook..Not feeling entirely assured, we proceeded 2 our gate where there was already a few dozen other unhappy folks waiting 2talk2 ONE teller @the gate. He made a few announcements about calling delta directly 2address flight issues as he is only 1man & it would be a long night 4him2address every single flight issue. So we called Delta &the person on the line was friendly & went about helping us 2reschedule our 2nd flight &told us 2 contact the delta staff @LAX once landing regarding hotel vouchers 4our overnight stay. Then when we went back 2our gate 2 confirm other flight details, the same obnoxious teller we initially met from the guest special services line joined. When we discussed our new rescheduled flight the teller AGAIN stated that we would not miss our flight &,since he's such an expert, that this was an exaggeration as stated the 1st time. WithNoEvidenceHe proceeded 2cancel our rescheduled flight &rebook us on our original 2ndflight. So far it's been 1.5 hours spent talking 2various agents on the phone & in-person due2 this ridic delay in case your counting.

Since the flight itself was less than a1/2 hour, there was a glimmer of hope that we'd probably be able 2make it2 our connecting flight in time. We actually DID land @LAX by 9:40 pm &it was encouraging. Until we realized we were SITTING ON THE TARMAC IN LINE4 A GATE 2CLEAR 4 YET ANOTHER HOUR. By about 11 pm or so we finally exit the godforsaken plane &talk 2the Delta staff there regarding rescheduling the connecting flight AGAIN!!! The lady helped us secure an overnight hotel voucher@ crowne plaza which was a couple of miles away. We opted 2leave our 2suitcases @the airport overnight &return in the morning4 a rescheduled 11 am flight2 Tampa. Famished, we had dinner @11:30 pm &had amazing sushi which was the highlight of my night. Hearing about our night, our waiter mentioned 2us that the airline probably meant 2give us meal vouchers also. Another patron even confirmed that was common airline practice in his experience. But not DELTA!! They didn't bother 2even MENTION a meal voucher let alone the hotel voucher until we asked. Ridiculous is not even the appropriate word...Now I'm sitting here fuming writing this review@2 am & praying that there will be no new surprises later today.. i.e. Suitcase issues or another delay (hope I'm not jinxing myself..).

I swear that flying bat monkeys from space could do a better job than you at managing lost luggage.After a 7:15am call to confirm delivery with the dispatcher, sitting around ALL day waiting, 2 pieces finally arrive by 2:15pm. In between this time, at 10am, we received a call that Delta had our final 2 pieces of luggage and would get it to the Logistics team right away. Having not heard from the dispatcher to schedule a time for delivery for our last pieces of luagge by 4pm - we call Delta and the Logistics team back. First we're told the delivery is 'complete'. Because the first 2 pieces of luggage were delivered, the Logistics team marked the whole order as complete even though it wasn't. After having to explain this, in detail, TWICE, to both Delta and Logistics, we are finally told - again around 4pmish - that the dispatcher will be arriving soon and we should receive a call from him to schedule our delivery shortly.By 7pm we still hadn't heard from the dispatcher. I call back Logistics and speak with a Jackie, who then tells me the dispatcher NEVER RETURNED from the last run so she still has our last two pieces of luggage and once he arrives she swears she'll personally make sure it gets on the delivery van. Isn;t she concerned that her dispatcher is THREE HOURS LATE from returning? Did he crash or decide to say 'F it all' and steal all of our suitcases and run off to Mexico? Who knows! She clearly didn't have a flipping clue as to where the driver was or if he'd be back any time soon.By 9:30pm, again, we still haven't received a call from the dispatcher or any word what so ever on what the flying fruit-pops is going on. Again I call back and speak with Jackie. She tells me the dispatcher just arrived, \u00a0they are loading up now, and that I should be receiving my luggage, at most, within an hour an a half. (Note that my home is, literally, 10 minutes from the airport and from her own mouth the 'first stop on the delivery run'.)By 11pm - still no call, no luggage. By this time I'm irate. I've been told all day \"my luggage would arrive soon' to no avail. I call back Logistics and speak to a Marcello who tells me the luggage was all delivered at 2:15pm. Again I have to go back through the same shpeal I've had to go over 5 times today already. This Marcello guy is useless, I mean like butt-hole on the elbow useless, gives me the phone number to his dispatcher who of COURSE doesn't answer. (Marcello knew this Keith guy wouldn't answer when I called.. just trying to pass the buck the arse.) Call Delta back AGAIN for LITERALLY THE 5TH TIME TODAY and AGAIN have to repeat everything all over again to this women who is testy with ME because I've had it at this point and am testy with her. She calls the Logistics company, who calls the dispatcher, all while I'm on hold, trying to figure out why I have yet to receive my luggage. She assures me they will figure this out and call me back. I never did get a call.. but about 25 mins later the dispatcher finally arrived with our damn luggage.Long story short, I was ready to drive my infitni G35 through their front doors and ram my foot up everyone's arse. Final Verdict:Thank you Delta for being so damn idiotic that I hope in the future Jessica Simpson is piloting my plane with blindfolds on and Marylin Manson is handling my luggage while ramming a spiked two-by-four up my rear singing Tiny Tim songs.

They changed the name of my child on the boarding pass without my consent, and it took 2 hours to fix. This is the second time it's happened.

Their boarding pass system tends to cut off names of passengers if they are \"too long,\" which creates a huge hassle for the passenger because not only does Delta refuse to let the passenger print boarding passes but also the cut off name does not match the traveler's ID. Delta needs to fix this system promptly. Also Delta created a huge hassle for us-their planes going and returning both had mechanical problems. It was unbelievable to have to go through this twice. We had to wait at LAX for 9 agonizing hours. Delta did not provide a back up plane and all other flights were full. We faced the same nightmare on our return...no back up plane again and so we were put on a red eye flight to avoid another 9 hours of waiting. As a result, we lost our shuttle reservation and had to pay again for a new ride back home. Delta needs to replace their planes with newer and safer ones although I am grateful they discovered the problems before boarded, rather than in the sky.

I have to say this is my worst experience ever. I arrive to LAX 2 hours before my flight departure time at 7am. I was sitting at gate 52 a night 7:30am 7:45am in the course of me waiting I'm watching Delta employees try and figure out what's going on with their Atlanta fly because they overbooked by 7 passengers and which they started offering complimentary $500 for those who would agree to go on a different flight then they upped it to $600. and over the course of watching this I'm wondering how late is my flight going to be because this is going on so I go up to the desk to check 8:55am in which you have angry passenger at the desk \u00a0by the time I get to talk to someone its 9:20am and they told me my flight was changed to a different gate and I had missed my flight. (The young man that was helping \u00a0really empathize with me) there was another Detla employee (women) that was standing \u00a0next to him that interjects herself into our conversation and yells at me well you missed your flight you need to go to desk services. I asked her with that attitude you don't need to be speaking to me.(this is the same lady I had been watching yell at other passengers about the Atlanta flight) And she keeps talking. The gentleman that she was helping looks at me and says she doesn't listen she just yells. At this point I'm getting very frustrated and tell her \"you don't need to talk to me. \u00a0Why are you \u00a0talk to me?\"and she is still yelling at me. I look back at the gentleman that was helped me and ask him what do I do now. She foes not even let him anwser she's yelling you just need to go to desk services. I yell back at her stop talking to me. At this time another employee \u00a0looks at her and tells her to stop and he comes closer to me and ask \"how can I help you.\" \u00a0I said it was never said that the flight \u00a0was moved to a different \u00a0gate, I never received a text saying it was moved, \u00a0I never received \u00a0a email saying the gate was moved and the screen be hide you never said anything about the gate changing. So how I'm I supposed to \u00a0know? ( BTW she is still talk at me \"I'm not scared\" why would she say that? Maybe because \u00a0I'm a mexican/black women that's not going to let her talk to me like I'm a dog..maybe) at the point I am pissed. I take a picture \u00a0of her to post to yelp and she tells me she is going to call the police on me and I'm going to go to jail. I relpy \u00a0call the police I haven't \u00a0done anything \u00a0wrong.

Stewardess' were so nice, friendly, and very helpful even if we were coach. With small kids in tow, they were still super nice & gave my kids a pin token from the airline for being well behaved & quiet I guess.=) Flight was on time and weather was great, too. No air packets along the way to our destination so we really were so comfy. Now, coming back to LAX was a different story. One of my kids had a meltdown already at the airport while waiting for boarding. We were on first class & seats were so roomy & the lady stewardess catered each one of us with her absolute best. Although breakfast was free & looked like an awesome meal to chow down on, I couldn't eat it coz my hands were full! So I just ordered an orange juice to keep me hydrated along the way home & it helped a lot. Fast forward, due to the meltdown eariler, my child fell asleep throughout the 2.5hrs flight & my infant slept soundly on my arms too. What a relief! But the bad experience we had was we had a lot of air packets during the flight and when we touched down at LAX, we had to wait more than 30mins to park. It was a nightmare for me coz right after we touched down, the kids woke up & i thought we wil get out so quickly but boy oh boy my little one started crying & crying & crying and crying. I was getting hot in my seat already & all the Captain was saying was it's only 10 mins wait but 10 mins passed, no movement at the tarmac yet. And when we moved, we would stop again and Capt will say the same thing yet again we have to wait longer. All the passengers were already getting restless & all we hear are lies as to the timeframe of our wait to park! That to me is not right and not professional at all. Kinda like the Captain was playing some mind games to us. And when we finally parked, everyone scrambled on their feet & hurried up to get out of that freaking plane. Nobody greeted the Captain goodbyes and what not.

Unfortunately, the airlines I prefer do not fly to Hawaii and Delta was the most reasonable option. Our flights were also booked by our travel agency as part of a tour package so it's not like we had a choice anyway :PMy mum and I both used their self-service kiosks at the airport to print out our tickets, both at LAX and HNL. That part was easy peasy. We got to the airport early on both occasions so we would wait at our gate until our zone number was called. I think boarding was done pretty efficiently both times. Although I found it odd on the way back home that they told me to go into the first aisle when my seat was off of the second aisle. While I was worried there wouldn't be enough overhead luggage space, that turned out to not be a problem as there were empty overhead bins on both flights. Which was odd since the first flight was completely full (so they said), but completely understandable on the way back since there were plenty of empty seats.I'm still bitter about the lack of meals given on domestic flights. It was understandable on the way to Hawaii, since our flight would be arriving 11:17AM local time and therefore we would be expected to eat lunch in Honolulu (despite it being 2:17PM in LA and way past my meal time seeing as I ate breakfast around 6AM to make it to the airport on time). But our flight back home departed Honolulu at 4PM local time and didn't arrive until 12:30AM in LA, so in my mind I think dinner should definitely be provided. Nope, they just give you a food menu and it's up to you whether you want to pay for food or not. I was actually going to buy one of their sandwiches, but then the stewardess showed it to me and it looked SO pathetic. For $10?! I don't think so -_- Thank goodness for the complimentary snacks!That's the one thing that I think Delta has that's better than some of the other domestic airlines I've flown. All of them of course offer the same complimentary beverages and you always get to select between peanuts or mini pretzels. But on Delta I could choose between peanuts, mini pretzels, or Biscoff cookies, AND I was able to request two items at once! So I was able to get mini pretzels AND Biscoff cookies. I love Biscoff cookies so that made me like Delta a little bit better... and the only reason why Delta is getting a two star rating from me instead of a one star.Why do I want to give them a one star rating, you ask? Because the flight back home was horrible. The flight to Honolulu was decent; everyone has their own touchscreens and we were able to watch complimentary movies or TV shows or play games. My mum entertained herself with Sudoku while I watched a movie. Headphones are an additional $2 but luckily I had packed my own ;) But on the way back, the touchscreens were not responding very well. Maybe it was because it was an older plane, but I couldn't press any of the options on the left side of my screen and most of the time the touchscreen would end up choosing some other option (if it responded at all). But that wasn't all! The plane was SO FRIGGIN COLD. This is where having a half-empty plane came in handy... because everyone went and grabbed the unclaimed blankets so they could have two blankets. Which really didn't do much good since the blankets are SO thin but it was better than having just one blanket. My mum even got a third blanket. People commented to the flight attendants but nothing ever happened. I wanted to ask them why it was so cold but the nice female attendant only came by when we got snacks and the male attendant that would walk back and forth occasionally had a scowl on his face the entire time so I didn't want to approach him. I have never been on a flight that was anywhere near that cold so I found that to be completely ridiculous. Being so cold made the flight feel so much longer than it actually was.When we arrived back in LA, everyone was so happy to get off that freezing plane.

Sure enough, what normally should have been a 10 minute experience but took about an hour, I was told I missed my cut off time for my flight as well and I was rebooked standby for the next available flight.

The choices were short ribs or rigatoni. I of course being a meat eater chose short ribs. It came with a side of sauce, garlic mashed potatoes, carrots, a roll, chocolate gelato, and a salad. I was impressed the short ribs was moist and tender. The meat literally melted in my mouth as with the flavorful mash potatoes. The chocolate gelato for dessert sealed the deal for me:) first class was not bad at all. I was serviced with beverages and snacks throughout the flight and a nice hot towel for my hands.

I waited quite some time to access the check in quiosk and then when I was ready to check in and print out our boarding passes I asked about my son and showed the agent the infant ticket that was mailed to me when I booked my flight in December. The agent told me to head over to Special Services because I was suppose to check in over there so he cancelled my check-in at the quiosk and directed me to special services. I again waited in another line and when I finally reached an agent she looked at me and asked me what I needed. This customer service agent's name was Aja. I said \"They sent me over here because of this\" and I showed her my son's infant ticket. She very rudely replied \"and what is that?\" That was my first red flag. How can a customer service agent not know what an infant ticket looks like? Ok! So then, I proceeded to explain that my son was a lap infant and that Delta mailed me the ticket and I was trying to check in, print out my boarding passes and get on my plane. She took the infant ticket and looked through it very confused. She typed on her computer and then looked at the infant ticket once more. Then she asked for all 4 of our passports so I handed them to her. She would very lazily flip through our passports then again look at my son's ticket, then again try to type something on her computer. It took her a very long time to figure out what was going on. It wasn't until another customer service agent named Cameron, walked over looked at the infant ticket and then TOLD HER it was an actual infant ticket! So she finally figured it out and she slakly proceeded to try to print our boarding passes ONLY that by the time she got to it she was restricted. AGAIN... she had absolutely no idea why she was restricted and called over another customer service agent. This lady, who's name I failed to note, walked over and recognized that it was restricted because of the one hour time limit to board international fights. After all of that wasted time almost an hour and a half of trying to figure out what to do, they pretty much tell me I had missed my flight and I would not be able to board. As you can imagine I was very distraught, frustrated and angry. I booked my flights in advanced, prepared all of my documents, got to the airport with plenty on time to check in, yet because of this customer service agent's ineptitude my family and I missed our flight! I immediatly asked for a supervisor and once again it was Cameron who called NOT the rude incompetent agent who was assisting me. After waiting another 10 to 15 minutes the supervisor finally walked over. I believe his name was Andres. He told me a couple of times that there was absolutely nothing he could do except book me another flight. I was infuriated! I could not believe that I missed my flight because of Delta's agents! At this point I had no other choice than to book the following flight to Guatemala. As the supervisor was booking my flight, Cameron informed me that If I would like to check in for the flight the following day I was only about 20 minutes from check in time and that he would gladly check me in if I decided to do that. Of course I said yes! I waited about 20-25 minutes for the clock to strike 11:55pm and then I walked over to Cameron to check in with him. After the awful experience with the prior agent who was totally inadequate, Cameron Cartwright was amazing. He printed out our boarding passes and then at my request was able to change our return date from March 26th to March 27th. He called to make sure the date change was possible and confirmed the validity of my son's infant ticket for the following flight. I'm still upset about what happened because it messed up our plans and car rental but I must say that Cameron did all that he could to make me and my family feel better. I hope that future customer service agents and check in agents get more information and training on dealing with infant tickets so that this doesn't happen to another family ever again.

I make this flight regularly. Well, unfortunately, there had been a gate change & my printed (by Delta that morning) boarding pass had the wrong gate.As always, I confirmed with the Sky Club as to whether the flight was yet boarding & was told 5 mins. So I got my stuff and off I went with my service dog, I get to the gate, they scan the boarding pass & all seems normal until someone is sitting in 4D. After some back & forth, the agent finally realizes it's the wrong plane & says I probably won't make my flight... Then she tells me to run. Um, a) I'm recovering from pneumonia b) I have asthma and c) I have a lung disorder that makes this a baaaad idea at the moment. I move as fast as I can & beg her or someone to call my gate as sometimes they will hold the plane & clearly, I'd checked in. Nope. She didn't bother. Thanks a lot...Well I get there & they've closed the boarding doors. I'm screwed. They tell me to go find an agent in a red coat at Gate 50, which I do... I join what seems to be the line of other people who missed the same flight. Now here comes the story...Her: you're not in line. The line begins in front of me, not to the side. I'll take the next guest. :motions to a person in her colleague's line. (I was behind everyone else who has branched off to the side.)Whatever. I go stand in front of her and wait.I finally make it up to the front and explain what happened, including that for health reasons, That although I moved as quickly as possible, I could not run without issue.So naturally she accuses me of being negligent & lying about why I missed my flight! Uh, I don't reek of alcohol. I haven't even had so much as a cocktail. I'm speaking clearly... So WTF?! I ignore her attitude & ask what I need to do to get rebooked on a later flight.Her: let's see... I can get you on a 1:10 flight, but it will be in economy. It's seat 23E (aka the back and the dreaded middle row.)Me: um, I booked and paid for a first class ticket.Her: Yes, and you would have been in first class had you gotten on the correct flight by regularly checking the monitors.Me: that's all well & good, however, this was not a discounted fare. I didn't redeem an awards ticket, nor did I pay with miles. Therefore I would like a seat the first class cabin as that is what was paid for.Her: You shouldn't have missed your flight then. First class \u00a0is entirely booked.Me: What about on some of your later departures?Her: I'm sorry, there are not any first class seats available, (Prints off the Eco boarding pass & hands it to me.) Hopefully you'll make it on time & check the monitors more closely.I was so pissed, I actually started tweeting DeltaAssist! Long story short, who cleaned this mess up & got me on the same flight this agent claimed had sold out of first class tickets? The SkyClub. I went back, explained the situation & within all of two minutes, I had a new ticket in the cabin for which I'd paid. No problem. No hassle. No bitchy attitude. Lying to your frequent fliers who also pay to access your SkyClubs, never mind actively seek out your airline even if the cost is a bit higher is not the way to retain business!

I was very surprised to hear from her that in NY, while waiting for her connecting flight, they served her and the other kids good quality food.I also like that Delta provides a separate room for the children waiting for their international connecting flight.

This review is for Delta at the airport-not the actual flight. My husband and I were flying my very disabled mother and father across country because they were moving. If not for that, they would never fly, being as their health is so bad. Two women who work for Delta come up to \"help\" us. They get my parents in wheelchairs and since my husband and I were the only ones who could transfer the luggage, we asked for a cart. The woman says it's $5, so my husband gives her a $20 and asks for change. Well she gives the change to my dad so we thought she pocketed the whole amount. Once that got figured out we start pushing the luggage cart and a gentleman at the outdoor counter says he could check our bags. That was nice, since that meant the bags were out of our hands, however we wasted money on a cart to push our luggage not even 10 feet-the woman could've told us we could check our bags right there outside but she got our money, oh well. Now on to TSA, which ironically was the best service we got! The TSA ppl were very nice and helpful. The two women who were pushing my parents wheelchairs continued to go downhill however. We had 4 carry ons, which my husband and I were trying to put on the counter to get checked. I start opening one because you're supposed to take laptops out of your carry ons. One of the wheelchair women grabs it from me and says \"NO! Leave it alone!!\" I tried telling her I'm taking the laptop out like I'm supposed to but she interrupts me and tells me to let her do her job. Because of her, we got held up for almost 45 minutes while the TSA agent had to go through the bags and whatnot. Then the wheelchair lady blames ME for the hold up. The TSA agents saw her yell at me to not open the bags, so they yell at her for blaming me when it was her fault. Now my parents can't walk without walkers, so they needed to get a pat down since they couldn't walk through the X-ray machine. Both wheelchair women start quizzing them, \"Are you sure you're disabled? You can't walk through the machines? Are you sure?\" They had no right to question my parents who I know for a fact can barely walk even WITH walkers. Finally we get through that whole mess. My husband confronts one of the wheelchair women about her questioning my parents and how unprofessional that was. She tells him \"I don't understand why you're getting mean. (He wasn't) I'm just doing my job, why are you mad at me?\" Oh, before I forget, I actually overheard the two wheelchair women talking very badly about my parents while they were getting patted down, they said very mean things and it really hurt me to see that people who are supposed to help the disabled could treat them so poorly, especially when they're nothing but kind and it's obvious they wish they could do more than they can. Moving on, my dad asks if they can push him to our airplane gate. The lady replies, \"We can a half hour before your flight. If that's not good enough, you can walk.\" Thankfully my poor dad didn't hear that and our gate was super close, so they did end up bringing him to the gate. Once they were leaving, one of the women tells my mom \"Your son in law is so mean.\" My mom replies \"He's a sweetheart, he's actually s nurse.\" He's a nurse who only speaks up when he sees abuse of the elderly and infirm, which we experienced much of with these two women. The lady looked kind of scared when my mom said that. Once they were gone, everyone else was extremely helpful and the flight crew was amazing.

The priority check in area is also new and easy to get thru. security is right up the escalators and fairly quick. the food options have gotten better, though the terminal can still get rather crowded. delta flights out of this new terminal have also been on time so far. the best flights delta now offers are the shuttle flights leaving from LAX to SFO. you get a seperate check in area at the new terminal. the planes are either a boeing 717 or an embraer 175. i personally like the 717 when travelling with another person, the embraer is better if travelling by yourself. both aircrafts offer more legroom and width compared to other regional smaller planes. delta offers free beer and wine for everybody on the plane. everyone also get snacks from LUVO, which are healthier and pretty tasty. The best thing about these flights is that they have to leave and arrive on time and have departures almost every hour the entire day. they also, assign the closest gate possible once you pass security. plus if you have deltas app, you can track your baggage and they gurantee you bag will be out no longer then 20min after you get off the plane. so far, they have delivered and now this shuttle flight is now my go to flight to the bay area. recommended."}, {"count": 1212, "date": "1/22/2017", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "The worst customer service for any airline.

I had a horrible experience back in 06' while flying out to Buffalo, NY through Delta. Fast forward to 2014; I recently booked a flight to Denver, CO for a last minute family get together. I was VERY hesitant when it came to booking with Delta, as mentioned before, my experience with them in the past was dreadful.I figured it's been a few years, so they probably have had to have upped their game.. right? RIGHT? Overall, yes they've upped their game. The ease and ability to walk up to a Delta Check-in Kiosk with your itinerary, punch in your itinerary #, print your boarding pass and go has made traveling solo a wonderful experience. *You can say the same for most other airlines because they have check-in kiosks as well.Boarding was smooth, we were greeted with a smile (or at least I was) and our flight went out on time.The plane itself was kind of like an old bus. The seats were worn and torn, while the clean up crew did a sub-par to mediocre job on the clean ups; stains that have been there for years, trash from previous flights, etc. There was decent leg room, but for a guy with broad shoulders, most planes aren't equipped for lanky people like myself. I usually end up next to someone bigger than I, and we end up fighting for the arm rest. When things like this happen I'll occasionally hum the tune \"Put your head on my shoulder.. Hold me in your arms, baaaaby\" - Paul Anka, cause people don't get personal space so you might as well just fall asleep on me, jerkwad. They boast about Delta WiFi.. which isn't free. I got on thinking the whole time that I'd be able to line up a bunch of videos and music and just go for the ride. I think it was like $7 for 30 minutes of WiFi. I usually bring reading material for these exact moments ..and I'm glad I did.Our flight was less than two hours, so I was surprised to hear we were getting complimentary drinks and 'snacks'. \u00a0Kudos Delta.On my way back from Denver to Los Angeles our flight was delayed and I had to find this info out from some little brat who was heading to LA for the first time. He had been bugging and bragging to me prior to boarding.. about Disneyland, LegoLand, Universal.. I'm like.. \"Been there, done that, go away\"I thought I heard my name over the intercom while trying to shrug this little booger off me, so I went to the counter regarding this matter. \"Did somebody call my name? I'm on this next flight.\" I asked confusingly.\"Ryan?\" The Delta employee behind the counter inquired.\"Why, yes. That's me. I'm Ryan\" I excitedly replied.She hands me a first class ticket. WTF! Happy dance! Happy dance!So we're boarding... and I hand my ticket to the ticket checker, and they proceed to give me the ok to go. I'm moonwalkin' and spinnin' towards the plane when I hear \"WAIT.. WAAIIIIT!!! Come baaaaack!!!\"Apparently, the ticket was for a Brian Hechl-stein. Too coincidental. Somebody is playing a sick joke on me, I swear. Long story short, they upgraded my ticket. The plane back was equally as alright as the flight out. Seats were okay, upgrade was decent and this round there were TV's. Though, the pilot created turbulence as we floated over the 105 / 405 Freeways and tried to play it off. Good one, bruh. Very mediocre overall, but I can't hate.

The flight was scheduled to depart at 10:48 am from LAX to a layover in Atlanta, with Argentina (EZE) as the ultimate destination. When my mother tried to board the flight, she was denied aboard the plane because Delta employees claimed that she did not have proof of payment of Argentina's Reciprocity Fee. \u00a0They claimed that because she did not have a receipt of internet payment via migraciones.gov.ar/acces\u2026, she would be denied on the flight as well as from entering Argentina. However, my mother had paid the fee in person at Argentina's EZE airport in 2012 before the regulations changed to require travelers to use the website only. Instead of a receipt from the website, she had a sticker in her passport with a barcode issued by Argentina's Ministerio del Interior. The sticker bore the emblem of Argentina's DNM (Direccion National de Migraciones), and was issued on March 22, 2012, expiring on March 20, 2022.My mother had been traveling to and from Argentina with no problems at least once a year since she had gotten this proof of payment from EZE airport. My father had just left from LAX to EZE with the same document only one month ago. She tried to explain to the three Delta employees overseeing her terminal (Terminal 5) that her proof of payment of the reciprocity fee was valid, and would be accepted by Argentina just as the online receipt would. However, the Delta employees ignored her explanations continuously, and claimed that the online receipt--and only the online receipt--was proof of payment. They refused to recognize the sticker with the barcode, raising their voices at my mother and treating her as an ignorant troublemaker. One of them even berated her, sniggering when she asked for his name. His name was Sabas. My mother, not speaking English too fluently, called me over the phone to speak to the employees in her stead, and to listen in as she tried to explain once again that her documents were sufficient. One Delta supervisor (his name was Jun) tried to speak to me over the phone. He said that, unless I paid the reciprocity fee online, printed the receipt, and brought it for my mother to the airport, my mother would not be allowed to fly. When I said the same thing as my mother's previous attempts to explain (that her sticker with the barcode was an equal proof of payment as the online receipt), the employee got annoyed and said that he would text me instead. After handing my mother the phone, he texted me to say the same thing that he had said over the phone about the online payment and the need to bring the receipt. Needless to say, the conversation was going nowhere, and I repeated myself via text what my mother and I had been insisting all along. He then said via text that regulations changed all the time, and that travelers had to pay the reciprocity fee every time they entered Argentina. My mother and I tried to tell him that the law stated that the reciprocity fee was valid for ten years, to no avail.By this time, the flight had left without my mother. Trying to salvage her travel plans, my mother continued to ask for help. The Delta employees told her to wait, then left to do other things. When she approached a lady employee at the desk, the lady gave her attitude telling my mother once again to wait and asking her with attitude, \"Can't you see that I'm working?\" My mother tried to approach other employees, but no one wanted to meet her eyes or help her. She had my father on the phone from Buenos Aires, and she wanted someone from Delta to speak with him to explain the situation. No one would take the phone. Everyone either told her to wait without saying what for or until when, or berated her for not having the internet receipt.Finally, she was told to go to the information desk at Terminal 6. There, a Delta supervisor looked over her passport and document. Having heard about my mother from the employees at the other gate, he barely listened to her explanation of the situation. However, when he saw her sticker with the barcode, he went over to the ticketing desk and instructed the ticketing lady (Karina Y.) to issue a new ticket for my mother. My mother asked him why she was suddenly being issued a new ticket, when she had been denied and rejected for the past few hours. She was simply told, \"Don't worry about it.\" Even Karina asked the supervisor why my mother was being allowed a new ticket when she did not have an online receipt. He quietly replied, \"Trust me, just do it,\" then disappeared without further explanation. Karina went to the back out of sight, and when she came back, she told my mom that she didn't understand why the Delta employees working my mother's flight hadn't accepted her document.My mother's documentation was accepted without problem the next day.

The first Delta rep 'Eric,\" refused to make any adjustment, and at one point told my spouse to \"Shut Up!\" He said this is an airport fee, not an airline fee, and also refused to acknowledge the Contract of Carriage (plain language) that Delta posts on their website; \" I'm not going to read a bunch of legal stuff,\" he said.

So my review at this point is just about making reservations for me and my dog. I'll be flying out of LAX. We'll see how it goes and I might might be back for an update. The reason for flying with Delta this time was for the amazing ticket price I stumbled upon. None of my other usual airline choices came close to competing and this helped offset the pet travel fee. This is also the first time I've tried to fly with a pet, so I'm inexperienced. I have a small 9 lb dog. Negotiating Delta's online website and its pet policy is tiresome and a bit confusing. They only allow a certain number of pets onto a plane so it seems important to reserve your pet's spot early. You cannot make a reservation for your pet online at the same time you are making your own reservation. They will not show you any information about pet travel options along the way during your check out process either. I ended up purchasing tickets for myself without knowing if the dog would be allowed on the flight. Probably not the best way to do this, but I wasn't sure at the time how to get this done. You will then have to dig through the Delta site looking for pet travel options which will eventually lead to a page where they explain the rules and regulations. You'll find out that they can not tell you online what sized pet carrier you'll need because every plane they have has different dimensions. Then through extensive reading you'll stumble upon a phone number that they expect you to call to set up a reservation for your pet and get very specific under seat dimensions for the plane you have a seat on. When you call that number you'll probably get some grumpy worker who really doesn't want to help you. Instead of telling you what their under seat dimensions are and allowing you to decide if your carrier fits, they will ask what carrier size you have. I said small. They asked for specific dimensions. I said I don't know the specific size right now, can I just go ahead and make a reservation for my dog. \"No\" was the answer. I had to hang up, find the dimensions of the carrier, and call back. This time around I got farther, and apparently succeeded in making a reservation, although I wasn't sure because the new person I talked to was mumbly and hard to hear. I had to ask \"what?\" five times. She asked for carrier size. I told her the size and then she proceeded to tell me, in a mumbly voice, dimensions of the under seat space. From what I could hear it sounded like my carrier wouldn't fit, but she booked me a reservation for the dog anyways. Why?! did they need me to call back with my carrier size if it doesn't matter. Wasn't sure if I heard everything right, and I had not received any confirmation that my dog had actually been added to the reservation so I called the following day to check on all the info again. So here's the final end results of all my calls and online adventures with Delta. According to the more well spoken Delta rep I do indeed have something noted on my reservation somewhere that says I have an in-cabin pet (There is no physical proof on my end that I have this pet reservation, it is all verbal assurances only by Delta reps. All you can hope for is there is no such thing as human error.) Also it costs $125 one-way to bring your pet and she counts as a piece of \"carry-on\" luggage even though she'll be under the seat. This leaves me with only a personal item like a purse that I will then need to store up top in luggage storage. Lastly I am flying on a Embraer 175 type plane which has under seat dimensions of 35\"W x 19\"D x 7.5\"H. Reservations for a pet with Delta is a hassle. I will probably look elsewhere next time I need to fly with her."}, {"count": 1339, "date": "10/24/2012", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "I wish I could give 0 stars.

There was no one downstairs to direct us to any shuttle, except for baggage claim representatives who claimed it wasn't their fault, and they 'were never informed of the delay.' We proceeded to wait another 45 minutes while the baggage claim representative was on hold with Delta to see about refunding the cost of our tickets for the flights missed to no avail.

While we were checking-in with the agent at LAX, however, she insisted that we did not pay our baggage fee - so even after trying to explain, she rudely shot us down and we paid again, this time in cash. (A look at my credit card statement later proved that we were indeed charged the $25!) The flight was comfortable and we arrived in one piece.On the second leg of our trip, from JFK to MIA, we spent two hours at Delta's baggage and ticketing desk, as they were unable to find my itinerary - and/or confirmation # - although I showed the agent an email from Delta confirming my reservation. Good thing we had arrived at the airport three hours before our flight, otherwise we would have missed the only non-stop to Miami that day. The ticketing agents were very nice but after being delayed two hours due to a glitch in Delta's system, we were not offered any type of compensation. On the flight back to LA, we did not experience any reservation/ticketing/baggage problems but my husband's video screen did not work at all during the five-hour flight - which was very distressing, as the personal entertainment was one of the main reasons we chose Delta. The flight attendants were not able to offer any assistance so we had to share headphones and he had to lean over to see my screen. Also, the bathroom I used was not clean - someone had urinated on the door and facial tissues, which was completely gross! When we retrieved our luggage at LAX, one of the brand new bags was missing a wheel.

The first airline I ever flew on since my grandma bought us a first class ticket from LAX to San Juan, Puerto Rico for way more than it costs today! Sometimes, it is a blood pressure raiser to read some of the reviews on Yelp. I like this website a lot. It sometimes gives you leads when you need them. But some people that review businesses here are mental morons, \u00a0incapable of distinguishing between one type of business in the same category. One case is airlines. \u00a0It is one thing to be a \"point-to-point\" airline that, say goes from LAX to Phoenix every hour (two cities with relatively no weather delays and an hour away) and operating an international hub to every major city worldwide (such as Delta's Atlanta). Comparing Southwest from LAX to Phoenix to Delta from LAX to Atlanta - - even on the same route is like comparing Walmart to Whole Foods. Why? Delta connects to nearly every major world city off that route and yet has to compete on price with the peanut-serving, joke-telling domestic Southwest. HaHaHa. Remember the food? Hey, \"The jokes on you!\" It's gone.Delta is an airline that has several types of aircraft. I like the ability to fly on some wide-bodies on trans-continental flights with great inflight entertainment on-demand instead of a 737! \u00a0Give me a 777 with two aisles, movies and live TV please!One reviewer mentioned a two hour delay and said they would never fly this airline again. Ok, drive next time and enjoy the gas and hotel bill. A flying aircraft is not like a Swiss train. I want to get there on time. But a safe flight is a priority, even when weather is concerned. Why does this even have to be pointed out??Delta Air Lines - - the ground staff : nice - - my flight : on time - - the flight attendants : courteous and professional - - the pilots : got me there safe, from LAX to Sydney, Australia. \u00a0And they fly worldwide - almost anywhere - with one connection. Southwest (although a great domestic airline) can't \u00a0do that.I do not know how someone can vent about your experience from Delta Airlines when they were still in the hands of the TSA at 7:40am...that is 10 minutes before departure when boarding ends and short of miss-connecting all of the passengers on your flight. \u00a0Do they hold for you and blow my connection in Atlanta? Allow for huge 70 LB bags for the employees to lug with no fees? I have advice - - get there 2 hours ahead of time - like I do - you would have been there with time to spare. \u00a0It sucks , but you would have been happier - - 30 minutes dude. The media has been saying this for years now. Domestic - 2 hours. International - no less than 3 hours. It may be long - - but driving is longer and costlier. I travel early and light.

Not a huge issue though as all tickets were outrageous due to the last minute part. While flying I decided to take advantage of this mistake and had 2 drinks.

Without going into details as to what occurred in the restroom( after multiple knocks from the flight attendant) I returned to my seat, and was scolded by the flight attendant for remaining there to long and was informed that I was cut off and she brought 3 bottles of water to my tray, presumably because she believed I was intoxicated and ill. I WAS NOT. Apparently I simply was in the restroom for a period of time deemed unreasonable by Delta.

We needed to get to Alabama for a funeral, so we were gonna fly to New Orleans and drive from there. Since we missed our flight we asked to get a new one that would go anywhere around that area (not necessarily to New Orleans). However, the worker told us that we'd have to pay for brand new tickets unless we flew to New Orleans. So we paid the fee of 51 dollars each ticket and got a flight to New Orleans that had a layover in Atlanta was leaving that night. We checked our two bags and then we're gonna head to USO. Then we realized that we should just drive from Atlanta to Alabama instead of going to New Orleans and driving from there. So we went back to the special services and asked if we could get our bags rerouted to Atlanta and they told us that we'd have to either carry them on or pick them up at New Orleans because they can't send bags to be picked up at layovers because they don't want people buying plane tickets with layovers because they're cheaper than buying tickets just going to that place.. Luckily we had bags that were small enough to carry on, but the people working told us at first we couldn't get them back.. even though our plane wasn't leaving for four more hours..

Luckily for me I've pretty much adapted to rules and technology. I had already checked in via the awesome Delta boarding pass APP on my phone, so this would be a paperless trip as was my luggage fee ($25 paid online). Our line was broken up by an attendant who started letting us through via their priority bag-check line and that was cool. Next off was the security checkpoint, which was kind of long, but not too bad. Once through it was smooth sailing and I went over to the Rock & Brews for a drink. When it was time to board the plane I was able to scan my phone and be let on. I paid a little extra for the Economy upgrade, which gives me a seat down in front, with some extra legroom in addition to boarding first. It's worth it. The flight was just under 90 minutes and we got there right on time for my connecting flight via Sky Delta - on their cool propeller planes. I'll most likely be back to fly with Delta, because they're pretty cool. I'm convinced that half the time folks trash an airline it's usually due to folks not really knowing how to navigate travel.

It was scary for them; they'd never not been with their parents, but there was no option for them to take this brave step - clearing immigration and changing planes in Detroit, hoping that Mum or Dad, or somebody, would be there for them when they landed.I assured them I would be, no matter what.Until I was misdirected to meet them at baggage claim. After waiting 15 minutes, after all the other passengers were long gone, I discovered the misdirection - I should have been told to meet them at the gate.I admit I was in a hurry. Any Parent could imagine why.I asked a check-in supervisor, a Ms. Jennifer Kim of Delta airlines, for a Gate Pass, so I could find and retrieve my kids. I told her I'd been misdirected by another member of Delta staff (no name, I'm afraid), that my kids were probably terrified, and could she help me, please?She told me to wait. Didn't I see there were lots of people here? (Small line of 5 passengers - who were all sympathetic, who all wanted me to get a pass so I could rescue my kids).I told her I was in a hurry, that I'd been misdirected. That my kids would be terrified. Again.She told me that if I wasn't polite and calm, she'd call security.I was being as calm as ANY parent could Possibly be, after having been given bad instructions by the airline, and knowing that my 9 year-old, particularly, who is autistic, would be extremely worried that nobody is there to take them.I asked Ms Kim if she could Please give me a gate pass so I could see my kids. I told her that everyone at the desk understood and wanted me to get a gate pass.Once again, she offered to call security.I know what you're thinking: That I was too agitated, and I'm slanting this review. Nothing could be further from the truth. I was biting my lip, holding my breath, and doing everything I could to appear calm while she exercised her 'power of the pen'.She, urged to do so now by other passengers as well as me, who could not understand her attitude, then Very Reluctantly started to slowly, oh so slowly, one-finger type into her computer.She was deliberately making the process as long as she possibly could, because Everyone was gob-smacked at her behavior.

Charge more and screw your existing customers harder are now the norm for increasing your bottom line instead of providing a superior service/product to attract new business.First Class used to be a choice of gourmet meals followed by an ice cream cart with a selection of toppings. On my outbound flight, all I got was a choice of pretzels and chips. Back home it was a choice of shitty pasta or chicken (which I don't eat). The shit they used to serve in coach is now what you get in First Class, and in coach you either get a snack, or when available, you can purchase off the menu.While I'm still ranting about the food, on my past seven flights, I have ALWAYS requested a Vegetarian meal at the time of booking. They have NEVER remembered to bring it on board, and in 6 out 7 of those flights, there were no alternatives.As for the check-in and security at LAX, do you want to be invaded by molestation or radiation, since the metal detectors are gone?

Even when I travelled on business purposes, I always tellthe company's travel agent to book me either Singapore or Cathay, or otherbig name ASIAN airlines. Never american.

Second bag, $75. I guess when you travel on long OVERSEAS trip, you are supposed to use your undergarment twice.. (gross..!! I have to throw away some and buy new ones on my trip.

They are at least 50 yrs old. (or look 50 since White somehow ages faster than Asian.. no racist remarkhere). But if other airlines can field somehow younger and more energeticones, Delta should follow suit. Or is it harder to hire younger ones these days to fly 18 hrs or more..? Not to mention the attendants ARE very grumpy and services is just down right terrible (0/5). Did I also mention about how old they look..?Third, is the cabin service. Again, the attendant is just down right grumpy and unattentive. You have to wait forever for them to come once you individually pagethem to your seat. And the meal service...down right suck.

The Delta Air Lines has 2 major problems:1st, when you book your tickets online and \"choose your seating\" arrangements, it's a waste of time. Delta, on every flight, will rearrange your seating choices. I booked my family of 4 from LAX to Atlanta. We chose to travel together (imagine that!). When we went to check in, we noticed they had us all sitting apart. They had my 4 YEAR OLD daughter sitting next to 2 strangers, 17 rows away from her parents!!!!!When we informed them about their error, that's when the real trouble began. They told us that we needed to tell the employees at the gate prior to boarding. We also overheard several other FAMILIES voice identical complaints and get the same \"solution\" to the problem. The 2nd major problem is the customer service at the gates. So, we get to the gate. No one is there. Finally we see an agent in the Delta LAX terminal and he was SO RUDE to my sweet, kind-hearted wife (who was simply asking a question) that I seriously considered punching him right in the face! I understand that sometimes people are busy, stressed out and having bad days... but if you can't handle working with people, choose a different line of work! There is much more to this part of the story and it will take a good hour to write it out verbatim... perhaps I'll save that for a blog post. I got his name and took his photo... Should I publish it? We shall see...Thankfully another agent was there and intervened. She was NOT able to correct the problem and get us our proper seat assignments but she was more than satisfied with her sub par resolution - splitting us into only 2 groups so each child was with a parent. There were some very kind people on the plane we were able to switch with and in the end we handled the problem our selves.As we shared our nightmare experience with people in Atlanta, every one of them said that Delta rearranged their seating choices as well. They do get 1 star for their friendly in-flight service, and their video screens in each seat-back which displays a \"moving map\" that plots the course of your flight and offers entertainment.We usually fly Alaskan Air or Hawaiian and they are OUTSTANDING!"}, {"count": 1487, "date": "8/13/2014", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Gate supervisor didn't know the meaning of customer service...Our family of 4 was on the way to Kauai from LAX when we arrive at the gate 20mins before the flight the supervisor shouted to his colleague close the gate no more boarding!

I told her that no, that it was OK and then we talked amongst each other what was happening and told me that she might not even be in the wrong line too.

They were supposed to be in domestic and international not special services. \u00a0They left saying how this organized everything was and how there's not agents helping and guiding people to the correct line because they had been waiting over an hour to and now have to go to another line and wait.

The agent told my brother he does not know why this lady agent could not check me In specially after noticing a fussy baby in my arms. What makes me even more upset is that two more agents came to help and guide people in the lines and were asking for families with pets to please step forward to be helped rather than other families with small infants. How is it that I'm in line for over two hours now and right as I'm about to come to the agent that's going to help me they start asking people that just arrived way in the back of the line to step forward if they have a pet.

There were only 2 attendants assisting. After one customer in line caused a scene, due to the lack of movement in the line, two more attendants appeared. We waited in line and finally decided to find out if we were indeed, in the right area. Long story short, we were not. According to a Delta employee at another ticket counter, someone had been sending people to the wrong line. We initially booked our sons flight via a travel agent. When we tried to check in, Delta had NO RECORD of his destination. His name was located, and that is all. The young man at the counter had no idea how to help us. There were a total of 3 attendants going back and forth as to how to fix this. When we contacted our travel agent, they told us that they noticed in their system that Delta overbooked our flight and even asked if we could put them on the phone with the person who was helping us at the Delta counter. When we asked the person at the Delta counter if they would speak to our travel agent, they refused to do so. The lady who was helping us shook her head and said, \"there's no one here today!\" \u00a0The end of our story goes like this: We have to go back to LAX again, tomorrow morning. They rebooked our son's flight. Delta simply overbooked, gave our son's ticket away, blamed our travel agent, and forced us to stand in line for 2 and a half hours before letting us go on our merry way. We will never fly with Delta Airlines again. If ANYONE from the Delta's PR dept, Special Services, Customer Service Dept, or simply a \"common sense\" department is aware of this post, please do something to help your customers retain their sanity.

The executives at Delta thought it was a great idea to squish more seats into a 757-200, remove lavatories, legroom, reclining ability, seat cushions, and flight attendants. Using this 757 \"refurbished\" aircraft with \"Comfort Seats\" on any flight lasting more than two hours is criminal. My 6 1/2 hour flight from LAX to Kahalui and my 5 1/2 hour flight back to LAX 5 days later - unbelievably horrible. There are SO many things wrong, wrong, wrong. Passengers now sit on small rocks instead of seat cushions and you get a pillow to put under your butt, there is no way to get to a lavatory unless you are sitting in an aisle seat; if you do manage to get out of your seat during your 6 1/2 flight it takes several minutes to accomplish. Once you have accidentally knocked the two passengers unconscious sitting next to you - trying to get out of your seat - you are free to make your way to the back of the plane for a cup of water. But because aisle space has also been removed, people's legs are sprawled into the aisles so you MUST navigate your journey to the back of the plane very carefully or you will fall down or step on someone and possibly cause an air rage incident. The poor flight attendants have closed a curtain and are hiding in a teeny cubby hole - that was once a galley - in hopes you won't need anything.

Yikes, that would make getting to work Monday hard, but listen Delta I am typically a flexible flyer who all but let this roll off my back. That is until I arrived at LAX for the last leg of my long flight home, I should have suspected something by the stiff unwelcoming demeanor of the gate attendants. I asked if it were possible to switch seats as, you Delta, in bumping our flight 4 times had separated me from my travel companion. I was told very coldly that I would have to come back later since they would not work on my flight till the previous had left. After occupying myself in LAX for HOURS and no more than 15 minutes prior to when we should have started boarding. I look up to see my flight is canceled. The reason being lack of workers in the control tower due to sequestration. Listen Delta, I am not even mad yet, things happen. I even felt terrible for your employees surrounded by yelling angry travelers. I am told they can not get me home (Phoenix) until the following day sometime in the late afternoon early evening as no more flights would be leaving LAX this night.

In fact she was actually yelling at me to call my congressmen about the sequestration since it was out of her control.

You did the flight bumps, Delta, not our Government. Stephanie would not let Delta accept any responsibility for my situation, at all.

Definitely one of the cheapest fares out there right now. Every time I check for fares to various International and US destinations, Delta seems to consistently be in the lower echelon of rates among all carriers. They are not always the lowest but they are always competitive. Their counter attendants at LAX are pretty bad. We were told that we couldn't check in all the way to our final destination and that we need to grab our bags and re-check-in at the layover airport. The lady at the layover airport told us differently and asked why the LAX attendant didn't check us all the way through. blah blah blah. They suck. Bag fees $25 1st $35 2nd. Now they have to know that if they are going to charge bag fees like these for all domestic flights, people are going to try and shove as much crap as possible into their carry on bags. That's just logical to me. Now when the flight attendant complains that you shouldn't have 2 carry ons (laptop bag and carry on) and that your carry on is too big even though it fit perfectly in the overhead bin, then you need to train your employees a little bit better. Either charge more for your fares and stop bag fees or teach your attendants to quit their whining. I'm a very cordial customer but will not tolerate chastising from a flight attendant for an unwarranted reason. International flights have free bag fees though. Woohoo! Video game/movie system - Pros and cons about this. The good is that you can choose your own movies/television shows/etc and watch it at your own leisure. You can stop/start/pause as your bladder sees fit. The bad is the touch screen display. Some people have no sense of touch, especially when they are playing video games. They feel they need to punch their finger through the screen to make the response a little better. This in turn makes the passenger's head who's sitting in front of them bounce back and forth from the impact of each gem destroying touch. Kinda irritating. Ending on a good note, if you are a frequent traveler and are looking for a way to save a few bucks, AmEx offers a Delta Skymiles CC that waives the first bag fee for all passengers booking under your name for any round trip. That's $50 a trip just for you. Just 2 trips and it pays for itself. ($95/year Annual Fee).

And he was kind enough to explain to me (through her) that my no-show/cancellation within 24 hours means no refund on that $1500 ticket.So I called the Delta Skymiles hotline; after spending an hour and a half on the phone with them and asking them to re-book my flights under my old name, they admitted their agent was wrong and re-booked me (under my current name) on a later flight with one of their partners (Air France) and asked me to check in at the Delta Special Services counter...who told me to check in at the Air France counter three terminals away...who told me to go back to Special Services and ask them to change the name on my reservation to the one on my passport (#!$*&@#).The girl at the Special Services counter was a useless fartpocket (\"you changed your whole name and you tryin' to fly international?? I understand you people wanna have American names and all, but you done changed your whooole name! look she done changed her WHOLE name and she tryin' to fly international\"). \u00a0She told me I had \"no options\", refused to help me, and passed me on to her colleague a few seats away.Fortunately, this man was apparently the only Delta agent who knows what he's doing and is WILLING do it WITHOUT A CRAPPY ATTITUDE. He canceled, then re-booked all the flights under my old name...so I was finally able to fly out eleven hours later than originally planned. Better late than never, right? Unfortunately, things didn't get much better after I left LAX; my next flight was delayed, I missed a connection after that, and then I found out that the airline had lost my luggage. But that doesn't really belong here...it just feels good to vent.

About bringing your own food: don't put anything \"fresh\" or the Ag. Dept. will not let you take it on the airplane. The flights were smooth and on-time. \u00a0The take-offs and landings were all well executed. \u00a0It was a safe flight and it got us there uneventfully.Oh, my advice about seat assignments -- DON'T attempt to select seats online. \u00a0You'll get screwed. \u00a0We were about to do that, and pick two seats way apart from each other. \u00a0My little voice said not to do that and I was so glad I listened. \u00a0We did self-check-in at the airport, and lo and behold we were already assigned seats... \u00a0Together on the flight out. \u00a0In the same row for the flight back to LAX. \u00a0I was OK with that because I ended up with an aisle seat and my BF had a window seat -- both our preferred locations. \u00a0If you don't like your seat assignments, get to the gate early and lay in wait for an agent to show up. \u00a0Then request \u00a0something different... or a First Class upgrade, which are relatively cheap on Delta for the right class of ticket. \u00a0We had \"L\" tickets which aren't upgradable. \u00a0Read the upgrade rules before you buy tickets and fly. \u00a0It can save your ankles.I wish they'd arrange the seats 4-2 instead of 3-3. \u00a0At least couples could sit together that way and I doubt it would affect the weight distribution much."}, {"count": 1606, "date": "6/20/2010", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "review": "Last Saturday, I was travelling on Delta from Atlanta back to L.A. Travelling with me was my mom, who'd been visiting in Alabama. Everything was to the highest standard of comfort and professionalism, from the Delta employees and their agents on the ground in Atlanta through the in-flight crew. It was perfection. Upon arrival at Los Angeles however, the breakdown occurred within 100 feet of where my car was parked: at the baggage carousel. Mom had two pieces of luggage checked on this flight. At the baggage claim, one piece arrived almost instantly, among the very first pieces of luggage to appear. Several moments later, it appeared as though bags were arriving less frequently and in fewer numbers. Traveling as I do, and rarely checking luggage, I know there is no way everyone's bags are together at all times, priority tag or not. And while you're waiting, you don't feel that bad when several other are waiting along with you. So, the carousel ran for a considerable time without presenting anymore luggage. Other travelers waited casually and seemed to just smile it off. Still, the carousel just ran, and ran, before it stopped completely. I shouldn't have to tell you this can be an unnerving sight. My best guess is that there were about thirty others passengers waiting for luggage along with my mother and me, many of whom had retrieved less than all of their bags, still others who'd retrieve none. Some of our fellow travelers went to the Delta Baggage services office, and came back to the carousel area. The word was that they (whoever was in the baggage office) had called someone then said \"they're on the way\" (the rest of the baggage, I presume). I can conservatively guess we waited another twenty minutes before the remaining bags appeared. In the end, we retrieved our bags and exited the baggage claim one hour after we arrived.My principle complaint is that despite Delta knowing there were several passengers still awaiting their luggage, no one from Delta came to inform us of anything. Speaking for myself, traveling with a senior citizen who must maintain a timely diet, and isn't necessarily the calmest traveler, these are extra worries I could have done without. The amount of time wasn't nearly as bad as not having anyone to inform us of anything. The passengers shouldn't have to \"pass the word\"; as soon as Delta was advised, I'd have expected a staff member or supervisor to appear to oversee the matter. So this Delta five star experience (and it really was five star) takes a serious hit.

As such, this review is not meant as a libelous statement but as a first-hand experience between myself, my travel partners, and Delta Airlines.Myself, along with two other people, were to fly out of Los Angeles, CA at LAX to Atlanta, GA and board a connecting flight to Daytona Beach, FL. We booked with Delta Airlines and arrived to LAX at approximately 6:15am. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 7:50am. Our group had to use the self-check baggage machines, which were somewhat awkward to use, but since it was our first encounter with them, it was expected. We had help from a Delta representative who instructed us on what to do, and was nice. The carry-on baggage was $20 per piece of luggage.Next, we had to present our baggage to Delta for weighing and general procedures. One of my bags was quite large and weighed 70 lbs. since I'm moving away to school; 20 lbs. over the 50 lb limit. The woman then informed me of this, and asked \"That will be $90, how would you like to pay for this?\" Since I really didn't have a choice, despite the ridiculousness of this fee, I had to pay by debit.I then had to go through security and let the TSA do their job. Of course, the line was horrendously long. One of my backpacks was deemed suspicious, so I had to spend an extra six or seven minutes in security while they inspected my boxes of pens and pencils, while one of my travel partners headed to the gate. By this time, it was approximately 7:40am. According to my travel partner, he witnessed the Delta representatives GIVE AWAY OUR SEATS while he was trying to get their attention, and by the time they heeded him, they told us that there was nothing they could do, despite the fact that the plane was still boarding and that the gate was still open and the plane had not yet entered takeoff procedure.Following this, the Delta representatives began making up excuses and telling us to go to Gate 50A to make a phone call to Delta customer service, and that there was nothing they could do. While they proceeded to argue with us, the gate closed 5 minutes into the conversation and they repeated the same BS. Not only that, but while the rep \"looked up available flights\", they began joking and laughing amongst each other while \"assisting\" us. With no available flights, OUR BAGGAGES ON THE PLANE, they cut us loose and basically told us to go away. They would not refund our tickets, and since I have to fly to FL regardless, they gave me an especially terrible flight that goes from 9am to 8:30pm.Finally, upon arriving home, we called Delta customer service and explained the situation, but appallingly, they repeated the exact same thing they told us at the front desk, and proceeded to quote their policy which states that \"they can't do anything.\"I will never fly Delta again.

Of course there was a glitch, because when I went to use the vouchers, one of them had expired (although granted for that very same mishap) they had two different expiration dates.

They told me I was late to check in and that I needed to get into a different line to try and re-book my flight. I stated that I was still 40 minutes early, she told me that they are no longer checking in any luggage and that I need to go get in the \"special services\" line to try to book another flight.Shit happens and i'm okay with paying a re-booking fee if it meant I get to see my friend. When I got to the line, there were about 30 people ahead of me in line. I stood patiently for about 40 minutes. The guy at the counter told me \"you're in bad shape\". I asked him what he meant. He said there are no flights left today that was free of charge. He then proceeded to tell me I shouldn't have been late. I told him I was not late. He said I should have been there 1.5 hours before my flight. I have flown 27 times within the last 13 years. I have never checked in that early for any flights, international or domestic. He said wait and he will see what he can do, he picks up the phone and let it rest on his shoulders for 10 minutes. He then hangs up and inform me that there are no more flights today or tomorrow. Also, if I wanted to fly to my destination I would have to buy a brand new ticket and pay the full price. Are you kidding me? So because of your lack of service I am 5 minutes late to my check-in time that i will have to forfeit my entire ticket? I was so irate I didn't even want to talk to him. I asked to talk to a supervisor. The supervisor was unapologetic. He didn't even try to offer to resolve the situation. Apparently my friend used his flyer miles to book my ticket because the supervisor demanded I call the flyer miles company to get another ticket. I don't have my friend's frequent flyer info so I did not try. I went outside and called my ride back to go home. While waiting I wanted to write a formal complaint, the female clerk at the check-in stations went to talk to her supervisor. She came back and told me he was busy and that I would have to wait over 30 minutes for the next shift supervisor because he was busy. I saw the supervisor she was talking to. He was helping someone with checking in but there was no one left in line behind him. He just didn't want to deal with the situation.My ride arrived and I left to go home after wasting 2.5 hours at the airport and loosing a ticket. I called my friend and told him what happened. He called the frequent flyer club and was told that there were no attempt on my part to check in so I had forfeited the ticket. Are you kidding me? He had to book another flight for me through another company. I only flew once with Delta while I was in the military. Their seats and cramp, their food are bad, their airplanes are old and have 1 tiny monitor per aisle. And most importantly, I learned today that their customer service is absolute garbage. I will never ever fly on delta again, even if someone else offer to buy me a ticket.

The flight was on time and all but the service was horrible. This was my first time flying with Delta. It was a 5hr trip from LA to NYC. First off, they charge you $15 for every bag you check in. I've never had to pay extra to check in luggage before. United doesn't do it, neither does AA. I don't think that passengers who pay the airlines should pay more for something that should be included in the fare. It's not that hard. Oh... and to add on to the costs... they charge you two bucks for earphones... EARPHONES!!!! Those crappy plastic things that always hurt my ears. I'd rather watch the movie in silence and read their lips than pay for crappy earphones. If I had to pay, they better to freakin' comfortable and good earphones. The stewardess was plain rude to us. When the drink cart was coming by, Julianne L asked the stewardess for a coke and water. She had to ask like three times. The stewardess just ignored her. and when we were trying to flag her down so we can give our empty cups to her and she shushed us and put up her index finger to shut us up. If it was the other finger... and you know the one i'm talking about... I would have ripped her head off. It was a redeye flight so I was tired already... I don't need to be shushed!!! She then grabbed the cups from us... and not too kindly might I add. I don't think I've ever been treated like this on a plane by a stewardess before.

Sounds like it might be a little close, however, it only takes about 30 minutes to get from Albany to NYC and my itinerary says that it will take one hour and 10 minutes. Sounds fine.Except when we sit on the ground for OVER AN HOUR in Albany and don't take off until AFTER my plane was set to land in NYC. That's a problem. The flight attendant tells everyone it will be okay and that they're holding all the connecting flights in NYC so no one misses a flight. (By the way they HAVE to do that because they've canceled so many of their flights that there probably wouldn't be a stand-by seat available for the next 3 days for anyone).I get to NYC and RUN AS FAST AS I CAN to the gate, which they've already closed, and tell them I need to get on the plane. I ask if my \u00a0luggage made it on the plane, they say not yet, but promise that they won't take off without it. I then get on the plane, and it TAKES OFF EARLY without my luggage.

They also told them that an entire CRATE of luggage for our flight was left in NYC.

With a few notable exceptions, most plane rides these days involve cramped legroom, lousy snacks for sale and indifferent booze service. OK... so this review is a little different, then. We just returned from a couple of weeks escape from the summer heat of the San Fernando Valley into the gloriously cool winter temps of Buenos Aires. Sorry, I'm not going to bend myself into a coach \"steerage\" seat for 14 hours in the air. Been there, done that. Never again. Advice: don't you dare burn those frequent flyer miles for a free ticket... particularly for a domestic flight. Save 'em up for an upgrade on a really, really long flight. Trust me on this.So, we used up all our miles (plus a few extras we had to buy) to fly \"Business Class\" to Argentina. In Delta's world, Business Class and 1st Class are the same thing on international flights. First, we get to LAX and breeze past the long check-in line to the \"1st Class\" line where there's only one other traveler in front of us. Then we bypass the long TSA security line for the special \"1st Class\" line where we went through in about 1 minute. So far, we're lovin' it!After an overpriced Bloody Mary in the LAX terminal, we board our chariot. We have selected bulkhead seats...row 1. Our thrones are about the size of King Kong's palm and include a keypad where we can select about a gazillion seat positions including an extended footrest. After sitting down, I tried to touch the bulkhead in front of me with my feet and couldn't reach it. I could have parked a Ralph's shopping cart in the space in front of me with room left over. We also had personal video screens offering a variety of movies, TV shows and video games... including interactive Trivia with other passengers on the plane. We're on the plane...oh... maybe a minute when the flight attendant takes our order for our complimentary booze. Later, we're served a hot lunch on real china with real glasses and real flatware. We were courteously addressed by name and attended to like punjabs.We had a connecting flight in Atlanta. Our departure from LAX was delayed and it began to look doubtful that we'd make the connection. When we reached Atlanta, we had about 5 minutes to get to our next airplane. The distance was only two gates, but it was still very, very close. When we reached the terminal, the flight attendant made sure we were the first off the plane. As we ran to the next gate, we met a Delta employee running in our direction who asked, \"Are you going to Buenos Aires?\" When we answered, \"Yes!\" she replied, \"They're waiting for you. THEY WERE HOLDING THE FREAKING PLANE FOR US! See if that happens when you're in seat 27A in coach. We reached the gate and another Delta employee greeted us by name and while leading us to the jetway spoke into her walkie-talkie, \"We have them. You can go now.\" Unbelievable.No sooner were our butts plopped down in our oversized leather seats then the flight attendant welcomed us... again by name... and took our drink order. That was followed by another meal that began with hot towels... soup or salad... an amuse bouche... a very tasty hot entree with sides... cheese and fruit... and finished with an ice cream sundae.

When I finally fell asleep, I was stuffed!(I've gone coach enough to know that those behind me were probably feasting on pre-packaged cheese snacks, granola and jerky that they had to pay for.)The flight home was a repeat of the above without the nail-biting connection. My only gripe is that on the final Atlanta-LAX flight, our seats were a bit smaller (apparently on domestic flights there is a slight difference between 1st Class and Business Class... but if you pick the right flight, you can get a plane with the better accomodations.) and our flight attendant was a bitch. Maybe she was having a bad day but when the man across the aisle asked for another bit of cream cheese for his bagel, she told him, \"Only one container per tray!\" Pardon me? We're paying through both our asses and our noses for this level of service. You DO NOT say no. You say, yes sir. Right away sir. (I gave him my cream cheese.)I understand perfectly that this isn't the ordinary flight experience... unless you're a Vanderbilt or something. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who fly 1st class everyday and for whom this sort of thing is just another day at the office. But, for a rube like me, it was amazing.

Apparently, there was a \"slight change to our flight.\" That's literally how they told us they were canceling our flight. Oh but don't worry, good news, they booked us on a flight for tomorrow at 11:00am. That's almost 15 hours later... for a trip totaling roughly three days. It was extremely frustrating as each day was costing us money. Friday. We eventually haggled our way on to an earlier 6:00am flight after a 30 minute conversation with a fairly rude costumer service rep. We eventually get there alright, and try and salvage one day of work. Sunday. We wake up to an 8am email saying our flight later that night (redeye) was canceled (1400 Delta flights in total canceled that day apparently). We immediately call them and have to schedule the only flight we can, which was a few hours from then to Minneapolis (no where near the direction we needed to go). Once we got to Minneapolis, we had to deal with a 4 hour+ layover before our flight to LAX. LAX was not the original air port we had to fly out of, but that was the only place we had a chance of getting to because they canceled so many flights, and we had to pay a taxi to get us back down to Orange County, which was extremely expensive. Still Sunday. In Minneapolis we had to check our bags because the flight had so many people and literally every one had a carry on. (I wonder if it was because Delta charges 25 dollars per bag?) So we check our bags and tell them we're going to LAX, great. We get on the plane, and its the oldest plane I've been on in a while. Very crappy TVs with terrible sound (didn't help that it sounded like a hurricane inside the plane for whatever reason) and $2 ear buds. I usually wouldn't care because I'm pretty easy going, but at this point I'm fed up. We arrive in LA an hour late (no idea why, everything just took longer: taxi, take off flight, landing, taxi, unloading). We manage to find the Delta baggage carousel (despite landing in a non-Delta terminal and no Delta employee having a clue where we needed to go) and wait for our bags. Oh wait, Delta wasn't finished, they lost my business partner's bag. He still (3 days later) has not gotten his bag and Delta has been unable to locate it. Wonderful.Cherry on top?

She needs to transfer me to online tech support to help me with the check-in. OK... hold for another 18 minutes and a rep came on... AGAIN told me the first leg is domestic and has bag fees.

For reasons both financial and practical (number of flight options available) we often fly Delta.- In this time, flight on other airlines, primarily Southwest, have run on time with the exception of one delay that was both minimal and well handled by the airline. Conversely, the vast majority of flights with Delta have failed to run on time, often to an absurd degree. Today he was supposed to arrive at 11:00am PST to spend the weekend together. Because of not one, but two mechanical failures with Delta planes, he will not be arriving until this evening. - Now I realize that this is small potatoes in the grand scheme of indignities and injustices in this world. Worse things have happened to better people, to be sure. But we get three days together a month. Three days. \u00a0And Delta took one of those days away from us. They did that. And it was not an unforeseeable act of nature. There was no Nor'easter or electrical storm that caused this.

However, they are a business purporting to provide a crucial service to people. People traveling for job interviews, to visit sick loved ones, to attend important functions - or at least functions important to them.- More than anything the frustration is born from a feeling of helplessness. Once in that situation, once informed it's going to be an 8 hour delay, there is nothing you can do. The only consolation is a voucher inviting you to spend more money to use their unreliable service again at a later date.

I chose to fly with DELTA because it was an airline I THOUGHT I could trust. Soon after I booked my ticket, I realized your airline was not flexible enough for any individual looking to fly domestically, or internationally. First, I had to pay 250$ to alter my flight only slightly, because my layover between St.Paul and Amsterdam was too short to make (something you should had picked up while booking my flight originally). I was flying to Europe for a once in a lifetime opportunity to participate in a rigorous study abroad program at the University of Oxford. Unfortunately, I JUST found out that I had to fly home early due to a collegiate student government retreat at my university. You then offered me two options, pay +$2,000 to change the date of my flight from Barcelona from the 20th to the 16th, or pay +$3,000 to alter my flight to leave from Rome on the 16th. My best friend, flying in your business class, paid $160 to make the exact same alteration! Having to pay for my own education by way of scholarships, working full time and student loans, I was forced to purchase another flight on Scandinavian Air- at the cost of just under $1,500!

To stand by your commitment to listen, be loyal, to earn the trust of your stakeholders, to act with integrity and to act in a way you can be proud of- as stated by your company itself. I hope you can fulfill the promise you made to me, a loyal customer, who put my faith and college funds in utilizing your airline, and to the thousands of customers who naively choose Delta everyday. I hope you change my mind, and put my faith back in Delta Airlines."}, {"count": 1884, "date": "8/30/2007", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "review": "On a recent overseas trip with connecting flight thru JFK I found Delta at LAX to be sorely lacking in personnel with an overwhelming number of passengers on a Saturday morning. \u00a0Fortunately, I arrived 3 hours early. \u00a0First off, International at LAX means Mexico. \u00a0With no one to ask questions I stood in the wrong line to check in with electronic tickets. \u00a0Finally, I flagged a haggered Delta employee who said I had to get in the \"green\" line. \u00a0Once in the green line there was only one employee for every other double kiosk. \u00a0I made the mistake of checking in and printing my flight and connections but didn't receive boarding passes. \u00a0Once I got my bags checked I waited in line not realizing I didn't have boarding passes for awhile. \u00a0After that realization I had to get back into line to get boarding passes. \u00a0I don't remember the food going to JFK or on to Shannon, Ireland but the Delta Flight out of Dublin was superb. \u00a0The food was great for airplane food. \u00a0Better yet Dublin had US Customs which made the entry into Atlanta a piece of cake. \u00a0Delta at LAX needs to get organized."}, {"count": 1885, "date": "3/1/2010", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Northwest Airlines, once the limo of the sky, fell on hard times the last couple decades and their service suffered notably. \u00a0Now, however, Northwest has been taken over by Delta, and the service is close to nonexistent. \u00a0The online reservation service is horrible, constantly timing out or refusing to let one return to a previous page, which necessitates starting over several times if you're trying to find the right flight times. \u00a0If you make a mistake on your sixth or seventh try, but think you've got it, it'll cost you $150 to fix the reservation, even if you catch the error months before the flight. \u00a0The check-in process is arcane and ridiculous from a home computer (You cannot check in until 24 hours before your flight -- dang, I was TEN MINUTES early, trying to do the online checkin from my work computer on my lunch break because if you do it at the airport there's an ADDITIONAL FEE) and carries a surcharge if you wait till you're AT the airport to CHECK IN. \u00a0As a previous poster has noted, the seats are so close together that your knees will likely hit the seat in back of you if the person in that seat DOESN'T recline. \u00a0If they do, harsh words may well be exchanged. \u00a0It's just a totally crap airline and I've flown my last flight with them."}, {"count": 1886, "date": "10/19/2010", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "review": "I was on flight 4782 last Friday night Oct 15 2010 SFO to LAX. Upon arriving at LAX there was no gate available for us to park at so that we could get off plane. We taxi-ed around the runway (stop & go) for nearly 2 hours before a gate was finally available for this plane. My earlier flight from LAX to SFO was overbooked (both flights actually were!) and some persons were actually asked to get off the plane as someone was already in their seat! The cargo space for carry-on bags also filled up so many passengers were asked to turn around and go and check their bags in! It was a miracle that flight actually got off the ground. It seems that the left hand at Delta doesn't know what the right hand is doing. I do thank the airlines for getting me safely to and from San Francisco and the flight went well once we were in the air. Delta also emailed me an apology for what had occurred on Friday night. Hopefully this company will get more organized in the future."}, {"count": 1887, "date": "11/2/2010", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Poor experience. Flew to South America business class.
