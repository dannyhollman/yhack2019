There is something called \"core\" seats that I am told do not cost additional money. However, there were no core seats available. But according to the chat agent, JetBlue does not oversell their flights; so a seat is available. As a result, I have to go to the gate agent to get a seat assignment at the airport. It appears to me, they do not pre-assign seats and through a message at check-in after one declines to buy a seat, that a seat is not guaranteed which appears to be a tactic to scare you into buying a seat. Really manipulative and misleading regarding their pricing.",

They just shoved their legal terms down my throat and treated me like trash.\nThey also have lied to me multiple times that the cancellation was due to \"weather\" concerns but when I called customer service they said it was due to construction and pilots being timed out, but called it weather because then they don't have to have any obligations for their customers.",

The flight to Florida was 30 minutes delayed, but the staff did their best to make up for the lost time and remained upbeat despite the delay. Aside from the short delay, the flight was wonderful and we arrived in West Palm feeling calm and ready to visit with my 96 year old Grandmother. The flight home, was a completely different experience. It's amazing how sour flight attendants can change the entire experience. The boarding process was wonderful, quick and painless. We took off on time with zero issue. The two flight attendants were horrible. They scowled, they rolled their eyes at requests (I watched one man hit the call button and ask for a drink, the attendant turned around, sighed, rolled her eyes, then went to get the drink..which he had ordered when the had the drink cart and forgot to bring him.) At one point I overheard one of the flight attendants complain that they were going to be shuttled to one of the major NY airport for a night flight after ours, apparently that's what put them in such a foul mood. It sucks, but it's also your job. There are often times I'm annoyed with things at work and I try my best not to make the world around me miserable as a result.\nBased on my first flight I would have said I'd exclusively fly JetBlue, but based on the second one, my opinion is \"meh\" to say the least.",

     "review_text": "My family took the children on a trip to Disney August 2019. Initially we were slated to travel on American Airlines because i am Not a fan of Jet Blue but because Jet Blue travelled non stop and we had three little children with us I relented and changed the flight to Jet Blue. Once again the flight to Disney was uneventful but on the return trip upon landing at JFK our nightmare began. We travelled with a $1000.00 double stroller because as mentioned we had three babies with us. We waited and waited and waited and waited, our luggage was delivered but no sign of a stroller although it was properly checked. When the belt was closed our worse nightmare was squarely looking us in our eyes. How do we get these three children home with all of these suitcases with NO Stroller. We promptly went into the office and placed a claim. The agent opened up boxes and gave us a stroller to use although it was not a double. With much difficulty we managed to make it home, frazzled but in one piece. At home we completed the paperwork to receive reimbursement for this very expensive stroller. Upon our following up with the claim Jet Blue arbitrarily decided to pay half the value of the stroller because we did not have a receipt. I have never experienced such poor customer service and business practices in an airline but as i indicated previously STAY AWAY FROM JET BLUE THEY ARE THE POSTERCHILD OF CORRUPT BUSINESS PRACTICES!!!",

The plans changed from landing on a Saturday to a Monday night so I went to change my flight only to find out that not only does JETBLUE not honor that when the ticket is booked less than 7 DAYS (EMERGENCIES CAN'T BE PLANNED) they stated they would charge me $150 to change the flight and any differences in the charges if the new ticket was more! I was within 24 hrs of booking my ticket, to begin with - THIS IS RIDULIOUS - I spoke with a rep to tell her my circumstance- POLICY is POLICY - I will never use them again- I lost the whole amount of the ticket basically because they do not reimburse bag fees bc it is all included and the credit goes in a bank for you to use (NOT) out of $219 spend I got a credit of $45 !!!! I have had similar experience years ago with American Airline and they sorted everything for me - with no extra charges bc they understood the circumstances and bent the rules a bit - IT'S CALLED HUMAN COMPASSION!\nJETBLUE HAS LEFT ME JADED!",

Firstly, several customer service personnel at several counters said they could help with a baggage issue that occurred, only to find out later that they could not do what they promised, meaning we would possibly be late for a connecting flight. Then, Jetblue told us a flight was being cancelled because of a storm coming in, but it wasn't immediately cancelled as they outlined and we booked with another airline. Jetblue tried to not reimburse my money, then after four different calls, finally said they would give me a travel voucher and if it was cancelled they would reimburse. Once flight cancelled, as it did later happen, it was a hassle to get my refund. I waited seven weeks, four more calls and several promises later, I got my refund.

Surprise surprise that is ok with flight in the US but on my flight I had to undue the paid and recyclable carton and get it wrapped in plastic in order to be able to get it shipped. Don't we have enough problems with plastic in all of our oceans. So I had to pay twice for carton and plastic. Jetblue you can do better than that. Also departure gate F 1 most be the ugliest and most uncomfortable gate at the whole FLL airport. All the rest as usual with Jetblue very good. On time and as high-lite of the flight we got a complete sightseeing tour of the valley of Mexico city unusually coming in from the south enjoying the state of Morelos the big Aztec soccer stadium with a very unusual clear view and got a grip of the sheer endless size of this valley full of buildings with still some bigger lakes in between. Just a great loop over the valley. Must have been for air-traffic control orders but still thank you Jetblue.",

     "review_text": "This JetBlue is the worst airline I have experienced. I had the flight with JetBlue on 16 August. When I reached Detroit, I didn't receive of one of my Suitcases (it had 23.5 kg weights). At the airport, I filled the form to track the status of my bag. From that time unitl now, every day I call them to ask the status of my bag. They hardly answered and always promised me to call back, but no one called me back. My staff inside my suitcase was so important and necessary for me. Always I said them but they never paid attention. I really spent the hard situation during this time. I was a new student here, didn't know anyone, didn't have car, and I was not familiar with Detroit. I lost my staff inside the bag and couldn't buy them. The weather suddenly became cold in Detroit and I didn't have warm cloths because they were inside my lost suitcase. I called them, talked about the situation, wanted them to find my bag or compensate their mistake. They really didn't pay attention. I lost my weight and became ill because of the cold weather. I was crying sometimes and really need their help, but they were really irresponsible people. After long time, they paid me only 650 $ for delay and wanted me to fill the form related to staff inside the bag with their price and details. I spent more than 10 hours to fill the form. The staff inside the form was really important and valuable for me. I really love them and I lost them. The expenses that I estimate in my form became more that 4000 $. But, two days ago they sent me message that we only want to pay you 250$ as compensation. JetBlue is really baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad airline. Not only they are not responsible for your suitcase and always you fear that they lost your sta, but also if they lost your staff, they never compensate it. Never try JetBlue.",

Plane seats were doing and let space was quite comfortable as advertised. This was a pleasant surprise! Attendants were professionally pleasant and efficient. Arrived Ft. Lauderdale at 9.05 am. Connecting flight to JFK New York was at 2.54 pm! The long wait meant we were now awake for 12 hours. Flight to JFK was on different equipment and the seats weren't as comfortable as the plane was an older model. We reached New York around 6.25 pm and departed on our final leg at 8.20 pm. This was the longest flight but this Jetblue plane was identical to the first and we were both very happy for the comfortable seats, me in particular with my near 6'3\" frame. Staff were pleasant, the snacks and drinjs, while standard were a bit different, especially the blue corn chips! Kudos to the pilits. They got us there 20 minutes early! I think we had a strong tailwind or something. So we arrived but because the Portland airport wifi was woeful we could not summon an Uber. Instead of paying an estimated $28 we took a metered cab and it cost us $55. We had been up for twenty six hours by the time we entered our apartment in Downtown! Our return leg was via Boston and again it was a pleasant early flight lasting 5+ hours. To our immense relief Jetblue had scheduled our departure gate a mere two gates away from our arrival gate as our concern was the very short 1 1/4 hour connection time to Ft.Lauderdale. From Boston we returned to Florida in just over 3 hours, again on a comfortable Jetblue flight. With the exception of one of our six flight legs I found the seating comfortable and the staff professional, efficient and pleasant. I will definitely fly Jetblue again from Barbados!",

As that is a major selling point and differentiator for JetBlue, and taht is included in the cost of my seat, I was a it disappointed. I also do not care for the practice of boarding people from all over the plane, and allowing those in the back to place their bags in the overhead compartments in the front, thus taking up limited space - that was also included in my ticket, and potentially preventing those of us in front space for our carry-ons.",

Yelling and being disgustingly rude, and then opens the door and allows another “late passenger” to get on as she rudely tells us to move. .. now we’re on flight #3 .. $90.00 in seat upgrades later just so that we can sit together.. this third flight has been delayed three times and is currently almost 2 hours past the last delayed timeframe.

We waited about 15 or 20 minutes, and in the end the co-pilot himself was nice enough to call someone to help us, as the flight attendants seemed to take the attitude that it was *not their job* to do anything about getting a wheelchair.\nAnd all during the flight, the flight attendant in our section was not rude exactly, but she certainly was not polite, and neither was she friendly. It does not take a huge effort to smile, even if you are working.

Come to find out that during the loading of beverages and snacks they broke a latch that would need to be fixed.\nDuring the wait at Boarding the gate agent brought out snacks and water.\nAnd while waiting on board a customer asked if they could BUY (purchase/money exchange) some headphones. The flight attendant acted rather put out as she on somewhat acknowledged his request with a nod. Upon return she notified him the were 5 dollars but “it’s ok” and didn’t charge him.\nAs that transaction was taking place another passenger caddie corner behind him also asked. She replied it a much louder and annoyed voice “ just so you all know they are usually $5”. But comped gets too.\nAsk for something during flight service (when it was being offered) and they acted like you asked them to give up theirs first born. This “Ft Lauderdale based crew“, as they identify themselves” were some of the rudest I’d encountered in some time. Wished we’d had the same crew who served us the week prior flying out to FLL redeye Oct 10/4/19.\nThankfully it was a newer plane with leather seats and working entertainment screens.",

This particular flight was extremely turbulent for what I feel was an extended period of time, well over an hour probably closer to 2 hours. The flight was so turbulent that no one could use the bathrooms and there was no snack or drink service. I was flying with 2 small children and they were extremely scared. People around us were praying and clutching to their seats and many were sobbing. One thing I need to mention is that we were forced to fly separate as a family so I was sitting with my children but my husband was sitting separate, and not in view. I even paid more for extra legroom seats but still could not be seated together. I was told that typically passengers will move to accommodate families with young children and that I should check at the gate. When I inquired at the gate I was told there was no way to seat my family together and the Jetblue rep was rude about it. The flight was horrible whether or not we were seated together but I do believe that sitting together may have helped ease my children's worries even if only slightly. There was another young boy on our flight that had a severe panic attack due to the amount of turbulence. It was really a very bad flight and what was most frustrating was that the the pilot nor the flight attendants gave us any information as to what was happening, whether it was normal and how long we could expect the turbulence to continue. There were no updates or announcements whatsoever. Upon returning from my trip I called Jetblue to discuss this matter and I was told there was nothing that could be done. That if it was deemed a bad enough flight that I would hear from a Jetblue representative. That never happened. It was so bad that I am looking forward to driving vacations for as long as I can manage, because I do not want to fly again any time soon. I am just happy to be alive and well after that experience.",

Arriving at the airport, the Jet Blue app (that was supposed to retrieve my boarding pass) was broken. When I tried to get help from their staff not only were they not helpful but they also told me it wasn’t their problem. I ended up missing my flight and the next available flight was 9 hours later. I ended up missing my meeting, spending the whole day at the airport, sitting in a chair. I called the customer service to at least get compensation back, and they had the audacity to tell me I wasn’t worth it. Then I sent out an email, explaining the extent of the problem, and in return I got back $50 credit for Jet Blue. At this time I was outraged. They thought they could get away with it with a credit that was less that 1/4 of the purchased ticket. I reached back again saying that I never asked for a gift card, and they’d better compensate me in a proper manner for everything I had to go through that day. I was then given another $25 credit for Jt Blue flight tickets. I said give it all to charity because I will not trust your company again to take me places. I don’t think should settle for this amount of money. It is ridiculous and insulting. My time is as important as theirs. They should have at least given me back the full amount of this flight, as the only reason I wanted to go chicago was for the meeting, and I missed it because of them. My flight back was with Delta Airlines. I had a very pleasant trip with no surprises or rude staff",

Then I was told there were no seats to move to but with no doubt they had a special seat for a co worker and when they called for anyone with a disability to board first they allowed him to board before them. Hmmmm that a bit messed up. When I asked about it I was told we as workers get special treatment before any paying customer. And this came from the red headed girl who was to busy watching videos on her phone. Can’t wait to land. Won’t ever fly Jet Blue again",

     "review_text": "I need convinced that we should use JetBlue in the future. We live in Pittsburgh and have used JetBlue for 99% of our travels.\nDecember 2018, Pgh to Naussu. We missed our connection in Lauderdale by less than 10 min due to a mech problem in Pgh before we left. Eight people for our sons wedding at the Atlantis.\nHad to go to the Hard Rock Casino for four hours between flights. The wedding planner said she would have to make all kinds of changes that would cost us a little more.\nJet Blue credited money to our \"bank\" because of their screwup and said we had a year to use it. This was after my wife had their CS department on the phone for a few hours. No problem since we fly to the Hard Rock a few times a year. Like getting two free tickets.\nOops, JetBlue STOPS all its direct Pgh to Ft. Lauderdale flights due to \"poor performance \" so NOW you have to fly from Pgh to BOSTON then on to Lauderdale.\nThe Pgh/Boston flight is not free and adds two hours each way to your intimerary. The price for Pgh/Lauderdale was very reasonable when you didn't have to go thru Boston. Now, we had to use or lose the credit so we booked the Pgh/Boston flight to Aruba.\nI am sitting in Boston waiting on the one hour and fifteen min delayed plane as I type this. We are on o way back home. Problem with the plane and a change of aircraft so we have to wait for a different plane coming out of D.C.\nActually, what happens is the crew times out and they don't have anyone else to take the flight. BAD scheduling\nThe same reason they cancelled a flight from Lauderdale to Pgh about 18 months ago and we got stuck staying at the Hard Rock for another night then taking a flight the next night.\nThis was the \"infamous\" 50/50 flight that was supposed to leave at 8:45 pm every night\nThey called it that because there was a 50/50 chance it was really going to be there.\nThe desk person here in Boston just announced that our plane would be ready to board and it was only about 58 min delayed.\nYea, I'll use Jet Blue again!

It was disgusting. I complained to JetBlue and was told they do not censor entertainment. What about pasengers who consider these kinds of movies disgusting. What about young children being exposed to these movies. Why should I have to keep my head down, or the child's parent having to keep their child's head down during the whole flight.

We were told that the plane we were supposed to be on was coming from Nassau and was delayed, so we were then put on a different plane coming from San Juan which was arriving at a later time. Scheduled departure was 12:59PM, and was changed to 6:07PM. The flight attendant announced to all of us on the plane prior to departure that we would all be entitled to and would be receiving a $150 credit. I even confirmed with her during the flight just to make sure I heard correctly.\n7 days had passed and I still hadn’t received the email with instructions on where to find my credit (they told us we would be receiving one within 7 days). After being on hold multiple times, I reached out to customer service on their website and received some answers (photos attached). I was told that we would only be receiving $100 because it was weather related and that’s what the airport told them. I received many emails notifying me of the delayed (it delayed like 4 times), and never was it stated that it was due to weather. Weather was not a factor that day for flying. Either in DC or Orlando, or anywhere in between. It also doesn’t state anywhere in their terms that you will not receive compensation if your delay is weather related, however this is what customer service told me. When I told her that the flight attendant told us all it would be $150, she said “I don’t know why they would say that”.\nJetBlue does not take responsibility for their actions; they do NOT stick to their terms that are clearly stated on their website. And quite frankly they aren’t helpful and are rude.",

When I looked for my airplane tickets I had options that went from $20 to the most expensive which was 69 and the $69 1 is the one I picks because I thought you know what I've never flown jetblue before and let me see if they're better not why is their ticket always double the price? But what a disgusting feeling it was to learn that I wasted my money and was miserable. I got on the plane and there is only about 20 people out of a 100 seats the plane was empty but it was so cold that nobody could stop chattering all of our mouths were chattering we turned off all the air vents it was still so cold we couldn't think straight so once the plane was up in the air in the seat belt light came off I moved to a row that was warmer and was totally empty! right away the flight attendant comes up to me and tells me I have to pay or move... and I'm like ha? no airline on Earth makes you move from an empty seat once you're up in the air? I said your tickets are already double the price and then you want to charge for every little thing??\nshe said yeah and you're also in an exit row so I can't let you sit there unless I train you what to do lmao. she proceeds to tell me go back to my seat and she will sell me a blanket lol. the seats here suck! they don't have a pillow like by your head where position like a movable pillow it's just a seat! like you're on spirit or frontier",

Another passenger asked them for a glass of water and they also refused. As the matter of fact, they paid much more attention to the guy, sitting next to us, supplying him with liquor and constantly asking him, how he liked his drinks. They also had problem with electricity on the plane, the lights completely went out a few times.

The entire process from filing the claim, to finding the bag again after 2 months (another passenger had taken by mistake), to getting the bag customs cleared by FedEX in India, to begging for approving the claim because the JetBlue Baggage Claim department is not able to provide the required commercial invoice and documents to FedEx. I have made 100s of calls to JetBlue keeping all my calm and patience. They never bother to call back and follow up. Sandra Cody (Sandy) and Luiz are two women who have no courtesy or customer service knowldege. Sandra Cody (Sandy) has been speaking with me in a rude and loud tone as if I am begging for something that I do not own. The airline is bogus. No care for customer's time, energy, and I am pretty sure JetBlue does not want returning customers.

Flight prices can be a bit higher than norm. My last few flights with JetBlue has been major pains and disappointments. Every single flights I have taken from January 2019 of this year has been delayed for the minimum 3 hours or more. My last flight out to Vegas was a disaster. I called ahead of time and asked if my flight was delayed. No! was the reply I received. Upon arrival and check-in all was well. I took one glance at the monitor the minute I cam through TSA and the flight was updated to DELAYED!! I said ok. But wait this is way to early in the morning to be delayed. Got to the gate, what was the reason I asked, Oh, we have mechanical issue. Better to have a working function plan than not I say to myself. Then another announcement, the flight as been delayed until further announcement. Flight didn't pass inspection. OK, my response to her was, didn't they not know about this flight going out. Of course she misspoke, well the pilot is not here as of yet. But yet we have mechanical issues and there was not plane to begin with. We waited almost 4 hours to get on a flight only to be told, we are changing your gate and waiting for the arrival of another flight to come in. DISSAPPOINTED AND ACCEPTABLE!! When we got on the flight.. not inflight entertainment. How sweet",

I frequently fly First Class for business, and on one occasion, Jetblue was the only option so I had to take it. Was I surprised. It was the best service in its class, that I had flown domestically. That said, forget about their website. It's the most frustrating process of their experience. It is sluggish and rarely, does it work efficiently. It doesn't stay logged on, and when checking MY TRIPS, it makes you log on again. I've often gotten all the way up to paying for my flight, and when I hit PAY FOR FLIGHT, I receive an error message. I've tried three different browsers and I have also reported it to them several times. It is the only reason (and it's a big one) that made me knock this 5 STAR airline down to a 4!",

Also the airline should consider offering hot food. Caribbean airlines does this on their flights.\nThe flight was smooth and uneventful. The old color scheme is bland and restful.

Also, we could clearly hear and feel work being performed on the outside of the aircraft.. After take off, we could see out the window by the wing, when the flap on the wing was open, It clearly showed a piece of rubber coming out from under the flap blowing in the wind as the airplane ascended. Notified flight attendant \"Nes\" who took note. Spent the entire flight back through all the turbulence concerned for our safety especially since we didn't feel as confident with the pilot's abilities. He never once spoke to the passengers. Made it back to safely. Buffalo (BUF)crew much nicer, friendlier. Orlando (MCO)crew seem strained. I would fly with JetBlue again but I'm not as confident as I was in their overall performance and safety.",

There appeared to be total confusion, no directions regarding how to place the tags after getting them, no direction where to proceed, no defined lines to give the bag to the baggage handler. Very stressful. Would recommend you arrive earlier than usual at JFK and find a Jet Blue rep to assist you if you have to check a bag. Otherwise, after the bags were checked, we had our usual good flight and service in both directions between JFK and Aruba. Aruba terminal check in was fine.",

I was at first nervous being I don’t really love to fly to begin with but I didn’t hear much about jet blue in the past. Long story short I was an idiot and beyond happy with my experience. It was the best. The plane itself was great, the inside was amazing and I felt like I was in a luxury top dollar airplane. I had a tv that I could watch basically anything I wanted, I could turn on 3D or 4D navigation to see the location and information about my flight, free WiFi, along with all kinds of charging ports, TONS of legroom, super comfortable seats that reclined, the head rests all have this adjustable pillow thing to cradle your head so if you fall asleep your neck won’t break off from slouching, and the staff was spectacular. I have to pinpoint and recognize one very special team member, Brandon, for making this trip so exceptional. He treated us with such kindness, and spoiled me during the flight. This flight just happened to be my birthday. My boyfriend had told him and he announced it to the entire airplane, I felt so special. He made sure that we were comfortable, taken care of and wasn’t afraid to have friendly conversation. Jet blue needs to show appreciation to its team members and recognize him for his outstanding customer service and just overall great personality. You are lucky to have him jet blue!

The Terra Chips are delicious and I wish the Iced Tea would not have been taken off the menu. My family flies JetBlue too and last time my mother found her seat and tray table dirty. Please clean the aircrafts better.\nStill, JetBlue is one of the best airlines out there. Comfortable seats and great inflight entertainment. See you again in 3 weeks :)",

Ok, fine, an hour is not a big deal. I check back in an hour and notice it has now been delayed another TWO hours, still not text, email or call notification. I get to the airport, standing in line to check my bag and check the flight status one more time to see \"FLIGHT CANCELLED\". Since I was in a long line I called JetBue while in line to find out what my options were and what they were going to do. I was told, so nonchalantly, that \"no worries, we put you on the next flight - TWO DAYS from now\". I couldn't believe what I was hearing. TWO DAYS - so what do I do until then? I was told they would not provide any hotel or meal vouchers and of course there is no way we can get you on another airline to get home because we don't partner with other airlines. I was also told I might have more luck at the counter at the airport - which is where I was about to be. The lady at the counter told me the same thing. NO HELP. I was literally stranded. I had to purchase a separate one-way ticket on Alaska airline to get home, and spend the night in the airport. That was another $500 and JetBlue would only reimburse me $50 - the kicker was that I had just purchased an upgraded seat for $40 and I didn't get any of that back. I wondered about people who don't have another $500 for a ticket, or money for a hotel room or food for 2 more days! How can an airline legally do this? I was appalled at how they treated me and how little they cared, and more so - how they just stranded me with no compensation, not even an airline credit. Please don't EVER FLY JETBLUE.",

     "review_text": "Booked airfare and hotel through Expedia. My partner and I booked a trip to Saint Martin, he holds a South African passport and checked online to see if he needs a visa to get into the country. After seeing mixed answers we decided the best way to get the answer was to call JetBlue, the representative did not know the answer. Told us to call customs/immigration, they didn’t know either. So, we went to the airport before hand to speak to someone from JetBlue to clear things up and take the necessary measures to make our vacation go smoothly, we were assured he was going to get into the country and the only thing we had to do was check in at the counter instead of the kiosk. We boarded the plane, landed in SXM, only to find out that he did in fact need a visa to gain entry to the island. Customs there said that JetBlue should have known this and not let him on the flight without proper documentation, that they can get fined for this as well. So as soon as we got to SXM, they made us board the same plane and go back to FLL. We now lost out on our vacation, after spending all the money and airfare and accommodations and I took my only vacation week for the year from work. Trying to move past this, and make things right, I called JetBlue but the representative and their supervisor said that it wasn’t their fault and regulations change all the time. Isn’t it their job to keep up with the new regulations? To have their staff trained and competent to handle these situations? I tried to make sure we were prepared and have the proper documents for entry but JetBlue told me we did! If they told me a visa was required I would have made the necessary changes to my travels. And now they are saying that it’s not their fault, and that they cannot give me a refund. Beyond me to believe that they can get fined for this but still tell me that it’s not their fault. Will not be using JetBlue or recommending it to anyone until they make this right. So disappointed by their lack of responsibility for their actions.",

I don’t remember what type of aircraft it was, but we were really pleased. Luckily we had a great time in Montego Bay, because the trip back was not as good. This aircraft had smaller seats, and my wife and I were seated next to a very large man who took up a portion of her seat and she could not even put the arm rest down. The flight attendant could have given him a seat with a vacant seat next to him. Overall we were pleased because this was a packaged deal through JetBlue.

     "review_text": "made flight and seat reservations 2 months in advance so that myself, wife, and son could sit together on the 5-6 hour flight from Boston to SF. we got the standard pre-check in boarding pass email the day before our flight but it wouldn't allow us to check in - when we called JetBlue they somehow had screwed up the reservation and given our seats away even though we had a confirmation email stating the seat numbers. We were able to get on the flight but only scattered all over the plane. When we arrived, my wife's luggage was not on the plane. we were told that there was a 'sorting' mishap and that the luggage would be on a plane at 7 PM and would be delivered to our AirBNB. we called at 11 PM to find out where it was only to be told that they don't deliver luggage after 10 PM and that we would need to wait until the next day. the luggage was finally delivered at 6 PM the next day. we were lucky that we were on our way home on the bus because we almost missed the delivery. they were supposed to call a few hours beforehand so that we could plan but they called only when they got to the house and we weren't there. JetBlue blames this on a 3rd party delivery service. However, it was Jet Blue who ruined the first 2 days of our trip.\nthe flight is ok if you can get the extra legroom seats. 2 problems: on a 6 hour flight that flies through lunchtime and there is no food served to non-1st class passengers. you can buy food that is VERY overpriced (captive audience) such as a tiny salad in a pint container for $12 or be satisfied with soda and chips from the snack area. also, there are not alot of new movies to watch to pass the time - on our flight, the headrest TV kept turning off and you had to start your movie over again.\noverall rating of 2 out of 5 is extremely generous.",

So we had no reason to expect anything bad otherwise. So, what we have learned when traveling to the Carribean. Be sure you flight is on a JetBlue plane to your final destination all the way. In going to St Croix, this was not the case. JetBlue partners do not treat you the same as JetBlue employees do. Our flight transfered in San Juan and we took a partner airline flight to the island of St Croix. Our luggage was left outside in the rain in San Juan. When we arrived in St Croix, everything inside our luggage was wet! What a way for us to start our 55th wedding anniversary vacation. The return flight was even worse! JetBlue was able to track where our luggage was and able to get to us the next day. Lesson learned is to be sure that your flight is booked all the way to your final destination on a JetBlue plane.",

After going thru security, the first thing I see are porta bathrooms lining the corridor...there is one restaurant and ver small, one small counter for other food, almost no place to charge...only available for 6 passengers, not enough seating for passenger waiting...so extremely crowded...the flight was delayed again..the gate agents are screaming over the microphone ...it's a complete nightmare.\nWe left 3hrs late...I paid extra for extra room..but so not worth it...their claim to fame are the snacks they hand out...I rather have good service and forgo the silly snacks.

     "review_text": "I was scheduled to fly on JetBlue, from JFK to Cancun at 7:30 am. I chose JetBlue because they offered the earliest flight to Cancun. I thought I was lying down on the beach by noon. Nope! That didn’t happen! my plan got ruined because the flight was delayed multiple times. spanning almost 5 hours, while we were on the runway of the JFK, the captain announced that due to ‘mechanical issues' we had to go back to the gate, then after they fixed the problem it got more delayed because of the crew time limits. To make this situation even worse, the entire crew members in the plane were very rude to the passengers.\nThe flight back to New York was even worse. They again had some similar issues, this time it was about missing screws on the plane. Nobody in the jet blue team knew how critical those missing screws were so we had to wait and wait (like for 6 hours) until technician in the US finally said it was ok to fly without them. Everyone was very reluctant to get on the plane after hearing they had some missing parts but we had no other choice. On the plane, everyone was so hungry but they didn’t stock anything to sell. We were all told that we would each receive some 'travel credits'. I thought I was getting at least half of what I paid which was $600, but they gave only $70 credit. I’ll probably waste that credit as I don’t want to book on jet blue anymore after that horrible experience.",

We had planned to travel to San Diego in the spring, but my husband developed a hernia that needed repair. When I called the airline, a considerate agent entered the ticket price in a travel bank—meaning that we did not lose out on the fare. Using the funds was a simple matter.\nWhen we breezed through the airport and arrived at the gate, I needed to make a purchase before boarding. Since it was not our turn to board, I thought there would be plenty of time. However, the process went so smoothly that my husband was at the front of the line when I returned. As has been JetBlue’s policy, the airplane door was closed well before departure time. Aside from a few bumps, the flight was enjoyable and every member of the crew attentive.\nThe positive experience continued at our destination. Deplaning went as smoothly as did boarding, and the wait at baggage claim was minimal. We have another reason to consider JetBlue our airline of choice—and they fly to every destination on our list.",

Unlike many airlines, Jet Blue offers services and amenities that most airlines don't offer.

I had a connecting flight in New York, also on jetBlue to Bermuda. Staff assured me I would make that flight, especially when it was announced that the flight to Bermuda was also postponed. 2 Hours delayed we eventually boarded in Boston. And there we sat on the apron on board for another hour. This time it appeared the water tank valve was broken. So we sat. And I knew I was going to miss my connecting flight. We eventually arrived in New York - four hours later than we were scheduled for. Toilets on board out of commission for entire flight. About 8 of us with connecting flights that were missed so we stood in a line for over an hour waiting. Eventually they booked us into hotels - 3 hours later. As if things couldn't get any worse, when I arrived at the airport the next morning staff told us they were about to cancel our Bermuda flight because only 80 seats were booked. Apparently not enough to justify a flight to Bermuda. But they swapped out planes (a smaller one was made available) and they got us all on board. After all this you would think jetBlue would offer to compensate me financially but nope, not a penny. I arrived home in Bermuda 12 hours after I was supposed too. Never flying jetBlue again - even if you offer me free seats.",

JetBlue doesn't have curbside check in at Newark, but once you get inside their staff is there to help you with the check in process. My wife and sister-in-law needed wheel chairs, along with several other people at the same time. The staff worked out getting the chairs for everybody and getting us thru security and down to the gate. They were most helpful, The gate staff got us seated and despite being cautioned by the pilot that we might experience turbulence as we passed by the hurricane, which was along the coast of the Carolinas at that time, we actually had a rather smooth flight. On board service was very good. Our arrival at Orlando went just as smoothly as our departure with help to retrieve our bags and get curbside, My total impression was that JetBlue is one airline that still values its customers. And it's seats still leave room for my legs. This is my go-to carrier whenever they serve my destination.",

An earlier flight had availability, so my traveling partner asked if she could get on the flight so that she could arrive home a bit earlier.

Sadly, the flight we were originally scheduled to fly on ended up being cancelled due to weather, so we both had to stay overnight in lovely Newark. When my travelling partner spoke to a supervisor after the cancellation, she was told that the information regarding changing flights was incorrect and he didn't understand where the gate staff got her info from. Therefore, my traveling partner COULD HAVE changed flights without me doing so as well. In addition to this error, the gate staff also told us that our flight WOULD NOT be cancelled since the airplane was already at the airport....wrong! We were cancelled within an hour of our departure time, and ended up having to spend an additional $150 for a hotel at our own expense. 2 of our suitcases were also damaged during this mess of a trip....not sure if we'll ever fly JetBlue again :-(",

About an hour after the first notification, I received another email saying the flight would leave at 3:15am. At around 2am, we received another notification saying it was going to be changed to 6:15am. Ultimately, they changed it back to 4am. The blamed it on the weather but both Burbank and New York were clear. They told me that it didn’t have to be in those two areas, it could be anywhere that JetBlue flies. I mean, that’s EVERYWHERE!!!! I tried to get compensation but they said, they weren’t responsible for weather issues. On our trip home, they flew us home early which was great but then we got stuck on the tarmac for an hour. So we left early but got stuck in the plane either way.

     "review_text": "I think Jet blue must go back to 1920's, By how they manage flight delays, And by how their customer service or help desk resisting to assist their customer properly is totally deserved a poor rating.\nThey dont even notify their customer ahead of time that there is a significant changes happened on their reservation, Theire customer mostly surprised when they checked in on the airport, they dont have a flight.\nOf course you will contact Jetblue customer service desk or help desk to be re-accommodated but believe me, all you can get is a flight that will not really suit your needs by a rude customer service agent. they dont even give you an access to their lounges even you will stay on the airport for 12 hours overnight no hotel, no free meal, in the middle of the freezing winter, waiting for the flight that really far from you paid for.\nLuckily for my friend, He booked his flight with a travel agency so someone is working for his flight to get fixed. eventually he smoothly refunded his money and immediately book a new flight with other airlines on that same day through travel agencies. (he was advised that the money will get back to his account with 10 working days but at least, it will get back soon)\nThe next time that i will travel outside of the country or even domestically, I will book it with travel agencies, Cause they will surely notify you if something happened to your flight, they will offer you alternative flight options and work on it .",

     "review_text": "My husband and I flew a round trip recently with JetBlue - Cancún - Ft Lauderdale. It was our first time going with JetBlue and in spite of a four hour flight delay, we left feeling good about this flight (and the return flight, of course, which did not experience a massive delay, thankfully). I'd like to commend first and foremost the crew at the check in counter - specifically Ilda in Cancún and Isdelia in Ft Lauderdale, who were so kind to give us emergency row seats, which made the trip more comfortable since we are fairly tall people (I'm 178 and my husband is 202 cm). The flight to Ft Lauderdale was delayed by 30 minutes due to mechanical issues, and once we boarded it was announced the plane has another mechanical issue (comms between cockpit and back of cabin) and that it needs to be fixed. It was apparent there was an issue as we could hear an alarm and some of the passengers were getting antsy, but the cabin crew handled everything profesionally and kept a positive attitude, even as we entered our fourth hour of sitting on the tarmac in the airplane. Pilot Chris and flight attendants Mandy and Leonard kept the spirits high, and we were offered unlimited snacks and complimentary drinks once we finally took off. I can't stress enough how their attitude and behavior improved this messy situation. Most people would go bonkers sitting four hours in an airplane, waiting for a 90 minute flight, but this crew kept things flowing and kept in line some of the more argumentative passengers. The emergency seat, as always, had lots of legroom, but from peeking at other people's seats, it seems there's lots of legroom in those seats as well. The high point was definitely JetBlue contacting us first about our flight - the company reached out first and offered really good refunds for our flight. We were thinking we would need to arm ourselves with patience and stamina and fight through endless customer service phone calls, and we were very pleasently surprised that JetBlue thought about it all already and issued us apologies and refunds without question.\nThe return flight was without any issues, smooth, again, the flight attendants were really cool and helpful - especially Alexis who I wished I would've asked for her number! At all rates, we are definitely flying with JetBlue again and we are definitely recommending it to other people, and we're keeping our fingers crossed that they will have more flights going to US from MX because we really just wanna travel with them now all the time :D",

I could not locate an airline representative or signage for an office site. When I called the airline the next morning, I was informed that the claim period...4 HOURS...had expired and their only response to the incident would be to issue a $40 airline voucher. While I understand the need for parameters to validate \"real\" claims, the lack of visible customer direction and true customer service is blatantly absent! It is appalling and shameful that a corporation whose only source of their hefty revenues is due to their customer base, should so intentionally disregard basic customer care. Such penny-pinching greed!!!!",

We weren't informed, but I was pleased with the decision. I just wish I would've gotten an email. I only knew we were transferring at a different airport when I went to check in the day before.\nThe flight itself was pleasant. The crew was very accommodating. They had DirecTV in-flight and I free wi-fi. Somehow they knew I was flying on my birthday and made an announcement, which was very kind. I guess the crew didn't realize it earlier and said they would've offered me a birthday cocktail. I was fine with it, but as we went to depart the plane the same crew member handed me a bottle of wine and said happy birthday again. It was a very, very kind gesture and I appreciated it greatly.",

While I was praying for this poor man’s well being, they were fast in identifying the problem, worked well as a team and their communication was on point. They stayed calm through all this and stabilized the patient. We seem to forget at times while complaining Paying higher prices on air flights, that these flights attendants have a hard job. Although our flight had to do an emergency landing to beautiful Bermuda, it was all worth it in order to save a life. At the end, we arrived a couple hours late to PR but nonetheless made our trip just a bit more interesting.",

We were stuck in the Bahamas for the hurricane all flights were cancelled except for our JetBlue flight kept delaying and delaying. All other flights told their people that theirs were cancelled so at least they can find alternatives in their jobs and their life on the other side just JetBlue decided that it won’t “ take the decision “ or tell the people that the flight had been cancelled until the last minute. When they told us that it’s been cancelled I showed them on my phone that they said it’s been delayed not canceled so they lie to people too! It’s been cancelled but u won’t tell the people because don’t want to give me hotel vouchers for example?!!! Then when I ask about the hotel vouchers because the very next flight it’s 3 nights after they tell us it’s up to the airport well , let me tell you how JetBlue and staff in the Bahamas rude to what extinct! They saw us 2 adults with 3 children trying to go back home and they know flights cancelled and the manager there was playing on his phone completely ignoring us until my husband told him sir we have been standing until u check for us for at least 20 minutes ! Yes he let us wait and ignored us then asked another guy on the computer for the first flight which was 4 days 3 nights after and he cared less he was not professional and a very bad image to the airport and to JetBlue. I called JetBlue and the customer service rep was loud to me and he was screaming at me then I asked to speak to a supervisor on the phone he said “ have a good day ma’am “and he hung up on me! Is this the experience u give to your people? Also that supervisor at the airport he said no travel vouchers for weather conditions??!!!! Are those the people you let us deal with as Americans somewhere else instead of being in a trusted hands???? !! This is the worst experience for us as a family. And beyond our imagination to act like this in a national disaster and I’ll post this everywhere I go and let people know about the true JetBlue",

     "review_text": "Like most of the american airlines, jetBlue is not 100% reliable in scheduling.\nAt 2:30 am, I was about to head to the airport when I got an SMS stating that my 5:30 am flight will be delayed for 7 hours, no reason indicated. After ~20 minutes on their customer care hold, I was told that it is a technical issue and we they couldn't tell how long it will take. I asked to be placed on another flight, but their options didn't suit my plans. They refused to place me on a different carrier's airplane, and they only offered 15% of the fare as a refund (my flight was two-way and this was my return). I am a frequent flyer and my schedule is not flexible, so I ended up postponing my travel for 24 hours, and missing a work day (which costs $$). The representative didn't seem to care at all on the other hand.\nI have learnt over the past few months that most airlines in the US are very unreliable when it comes to scheduling; there is always a high potential of having my plans messed up because someone there didn't do their job. Airlines have to be held accountable for their mistakes, and they have to be better prepared for unforeseen changes (yes; like weather being unfavorable). Passengers having to spend a night in the airport or paying hundreds of dollars for a hotel because of flight cancellation should not be OK. The fares collected are not trivial, and a good part of it should be put forward as insurance to be used in such circumstances. Instead, airline representatives are trained to give an attitude, to cut the road on any reasonable passenger demands.",

I recently tried to get tickets to Turks & Caicos and the Delta flights were booked, so I decided to try Jet Blue...well, I tried it, and I did not like it! They do board the back of the plane first, which is just common sense in my book, but the on board movies leave much to be desired. I tend to watch my movies on a plane, so am so happy to catch up with current ones...there were almost no new movies on JB; many documentaries, but that doesn't peak my interest. When we arrived back in NY, the line to get to customs was like a cattle herding...a winding staircase, packed to the gills, which would be a fire hazard in an emergency. Then the baggage retrieval was horrific...there were 3 planes on one belt, and it stopped when the bags filled up the belt...leaving us all to take suitcases off so it would restart! The saving grace was how wonderful the crew was.",

The disappointing was how long the delay was, the flight was supposed to leave MCO (Orlando) at 8:40PM. The aircraft was not pulled out until 10:35PM, that is almost two hours. It was a failure of the schedulers who scheduled the same aircraft that was coming from CUN (Cancun) to MCO to continue on a flight to BOG (Bogota). The schedulers failed the company. A two hour delay is unacceptable. I am glad the cabin crew and the boarding crew were very apologetic and explained the situation to the passenger. Additionally the flight crew did an amazing landing, didn't feel it touch down at all, that in my criteria made up for the delay. Kudos to the pilots. Because of the boarding crew and the flight crew am giving it a four star (circles).",

Other than that little hiccup, boarding was smooth, the flight was comfortable and we got to where we needed to go! The snacks are actually snacks that I want to eat and having cable TV in the air is a definite plus. Also this may be an airport/airline situation so not all fault to Jetblue but they desperately need to accept mobile boarding passes at Punta Cana Int'l Airport and/or get self check in kiosks. We were all ready to go but then were told that we needed to print all boarding passes so had to wait in line for 40 minutes to get a piece of paper before rushing to the gate.",

That re-boot entails shutting everyone's entertainment off for about 6-10 minutes.\nI think the planes are getting older,and the entertainment systems are as well. I'm still flying Jetblue,as opposed to squeezing into a Delta seat, I think you should be prepared to complain to JetBlue if you experience an entertainment system problem.You'll get a $15 credit in your travel account,hardly worth the inconvenience.

When we boarded they filled up fully so I asked the guy next to me who told \" he was given the extra room seat by the woman at the counter\" He brought his lunch which was in tupper-wear and stunk turning my nose hairs. He hadn't bathed and had additional odors as well. He obviously was new to flying as I had to show him how to use the table TV and that he can have free snacks and drinks.

We flew Cape Air from Chicago to Decatur, IL. Cape Air was the airline that saw to it that our luggage was located and returned to us. We never heard from Jet Blue.

We were supposed to arrive at 1AM.The hotel were kind enough to allow us to arrive almost two hours after the check in was finished. Jet blue never explained anything or offer nothing to any of the passengers. they act like they are doing the passengers are favor rather than offering a service for which we PAID!.

Even though they also charge for the check-in back just like others, I can still bring onboard one carry-on plus a personal bag for free. So I try to avoid checking in a bag if possible by packing less. I am about 5'10\" and the seats provide decent leg room for me. The entertainment in each seat provides Direct TV feeds and many other features to kill time as well. However, the entertainment controller on the arm rest is placed on the spot where you usually put your elbow so the elbow frequently changes the setting unintentionally. The best feature I like is the free WiFi. I could text while I was flying. They also provide free snack and drink but you have to purchase other meals and alcohol. My flights were delayed a few times, and I was receiving email notifications. The staff/crews I've met with were mostly friendly.",

     "review_text": "One of those experiences that makes you reevaluate your life, maybe G-d was mad at you for something...............\nWe got to the airport on time and moved through everything to the gate normally, screen said the flight was delayed, but listed all the initial times so I didnt think anything of it.\nWe boarded normally and everything seemed on schedule, I think just before noon.\n1. We were about to roll our of the gate and the captain said there was an issue with a food tray or cart, the ground crew had to come on board to fix it. This took maybe 45 minutes.\n2. Once fixed we rolled out from the gate right into plane traffic. The pilot said we missed our slot for the runway and would have to wait for a new one. We waited for about an hour and the pilot came on saying we had a slot for the runway...BUT because of weather we would taking a longer Western route and needed more gas, back to the gate.\n3. We got back to the gate and gassed up, this took about another hour.\n4. We rolled away from the gate ready to conquer the world. We drove for for a while, seemingly just circling the airport for the views. This took about 30 minutes.\n5. The captain comes on saying he cant get a slot on the runway so we are returning to the gate...for the third time and people can deplane for snacks outside the gate back in the terminal. They were told that had 30 minutes and had be back on the plane. The lady next to me had a daughter who got off and she was messaging her mother saying there were not aloud back on the flight yet. This took about an hour and a half. I later over head the flight crew saying that the reason we went back was because the pilots on board for the return flight from Montego Bay had hit their limit for the day and had to be replaced. So if your following along while we boarded just before noon its now about 4:15ish.\n6. We roll away from the gate and get back inline for the runway. At this point the pilot comes on and says that because its late our flight would probably hit the night and one of our night running lights is out, SO we head back to the gate. This is roughly another 30 minutes down.\n7. Back at the gate the flight crew comes back on the plane to fix the light. This takes another hour or so.\nIts at this time the flight crew finally decides to hand out some snacks on the plane. Mind you they still have not giving out headphones for the entertainment system.\n8. Its roughly quarter to six in the afternoon, everyone on the plane is getting feisty. We finally leave the gate and get back inline for the runway. We drive and circle and run the engines up several times. We do this for a while, about an hour.\n9. Then we start driving and several of us on the plane note that it looks like we are driving right back to our gate. The captain comes on and says one of the passengers is having a panic attack and needs to be deplaned. A lot of yelling ensues. We wait at the gate while cops come on the plane and escort this guy off. I am not surprised he had a panic attack, we was stuck on a plane for 7 hours with no food.\n10. At this point the captain tells us to deplane because they have to get the luggage off the plane for the family of the panic attack guy and this could take a couple minutes. Its now roughly 7pm.\n11. Unbeknownst to us we are deplaning into a packed gate of very unhappy travelers to Oregon because suddenly their plane is not there, but a plane of VERY UNHAPPY passengers flooding out of the gate. Because I had been sitting at the back of the plane I was stuck in the loading tunnel for about 10 minutes while the people in the front of the plane started a screaming match with the gate people. This got people in the loading tunnel screaming about a fire hazard. Once the line got moving again I walked out to a gate that was packed to the gills with two unhappy groups of travelers and a quickly building police presence. By the end of it there were probably about 20 officers spread out around the gate with 7 or 8 keeping people away from the gate.\n12. Its about 7:30 now and no one knows whats going on. The cops dont know, the assorted JetBlue employees around the near gates have no idea. I go to the information booth at the center of the terminal. The lady there thought my flight had already landed in Montego Bay, funny that. She makes a bunch of calls and says that several more flight crew members hit their working limit for the day and we are waiting for new crew members, should be in on a flight around 8:15. I asked for a food voucher as I had been sitting hungry on a plane all day. She made some more calls and said snack boxes would be given out at the gate.\n13. Around 9:30 a new captain comes on the loud speak at the gate and says we are waiting for a few more crew members but the plane is in good working order and he expects to board soon.\n14. Around 10:30 we start boarding again. The same whole process as in the morning. This takes about 45 minutes.\n15. At 11:15-20 the captain comes back on and says that several people have decided not to continue trying to leave NY and we need to get all their bags out from the under carriage.\nWe finally take off around 12 midnight. Its worth noting their were a fair amount of children and some babies on the plane. My wife and I were giving away our snacks to the kids next to us because they were starving.\nToday, 7 days later as per the JetBlue bill or rights I called to get a credit for my flight, as per the rights both my wife and I are entitled to a credit of $250 each for being on the plane for over 6 hours.\nThe first lady I spoke to said sorry it was weather related, no credit, so I went in detail through all the events listed above and she said nope, still weather. I asked for a supervisor.\nThe supervisor came on and said its weather, so again I went through the events of the flight and she said there was a small mechanical issue that took ten minutes, otherwise its weather. She said she would be nice and give me a $50 voucher which I really didn't deserve because of weather. I told her that is ridiculous!\nI can fairly say I very well may never use this airline again.",

The seating in the emergency door seats should be based on willingness and ability to open the door when an emergency occurs.\nTIP - at Barbados Airport, do not bother going before the 2 hour check-in time.

Usher people off the plane. The reason being is that you get so many people that are lethargic, inconsiderate of others, and they need to grab their bags and go. Flight Attendants could really help out with this!!! It's not like de-planing in NYC passengers are hip to this and deplane quickly because other passengers may be needing a connecting flight, etc. It takes much too long to get off the plane and Flight Attendants could assist with this. Good Luck if you are in the back of the plane! And it used to be that you could de-plane in both the front and back of the aircraft. I guess after sitting on the tarmac for 3 hours and then having a 3 hr flight turn into a 6 hr flight - people want OFF THE PLANE!!!",

The man stewardess (not sure what you call him) was kind pissy and bitchy. He seems put off when a passenger asked him for something or had a question. Seems to roll his eyes a lot. This didn't happen to me but I always watch to see how other people are treated and I was not impressed with his people skills.\nOverall I like JetBlue but they should step up their customer service. Maybe offer the blankets and ear bud for free and come thru with the little bottle of water so they don't have to drag that huge cart up and down the isle.

One of the lounge was shut and the other one was for aer lingus but they didn’t operate till noon. No there are no lounges at JFK TERMINAL 5. I was told it was owned by jet blue predominantly. That’s still okay.\nThe crew that served us.. I was sat in row 7. I couldn’t get her name. But the crew was so rude didn’t respond properly wasn’t sharing any info if asked and when served too had a very grumpy attitude. It was the first time we flew with them and for a flight over 4 hours so we didn’t have a clue of what’s included in the meals, drinks and snacks but she wasn’t helpful at all.\nI wouldn’t want to put down jet blue for the airline experience as the flight take off landing rest of it was cool but the crew particularly who served the front rows didn’t leave us with a good experience.\nHope the airline picks this with her!",

Great food (yes, this airplane food is actually good) with multiple options and the signature complimentary cocktail is awesome. They provide individual bottles of Dasani water. The individual pods with the slide doors and the fully reclining seats with massage feature are amazing as are the comforter and pillow (rows 2 & 4 are individual; in rows 1, 3 & 5 you will have someone sitting next to you but they do a good job of providing privacy with the partition and spacing). There is adequate practical in-seat storage for your electronics, etc. They even provide a travel toiletry bag on every Mint flight with good stuff in it. And they give you a to-go bag upon departure with a Milk cookie, drink and food. JetBlue Mint really makes you feel special. It is an undeniable step up from any other airline despite generally not costing more. And the Mosaic program seems very good. I only wish they flew to Newark instead of JFK, but it’s generally worth the inconvenience (longer commute to the city and worse airport). If you have an option between JetBlue and a different airline, pick JetBlue. No brainer.",

Flight to Chicago arrived early...always nice. Flight was smooth and uneventful. Smaller jet, 2 and 2 seats was nice and didn't feel crowded. Dunkin' coffee was a nice surprise as well as the \"take as much of whatever you want for a snack\" basket.\nMy return flight was delayed and I received a text notification. Got to OHare and discovered another BOS flight leaving soon so I asked about changing and they made the change for me with no cost involved. We boarded, taxied....and there was a glitch so we returned to the gate and sat for about 90 min while it was resolved. Staff was friendly and helpful during the delay. We ended up leaving about the same time as my original flight but that's ok. No big deal. Got back to Boston in good shape.\nI enjoyed my JetBlue experience and would definitely use this airline again.",

On the same holidays we also tried Delta and realized what a gap is between these two airlines while the price is very similar. Mint has fully flat seats, which on a flight over 6 hours makes a huge difference as you are able to properly sleep. The food is much better and there is plenty to choose from - you select 3 options out of 7 for the main menu plus two dishes for the dessert and one starter. Zinfandel was excellent and also the sparking (Roederer Napa) was very decent. Plus you also receive a goody bag with toothbrush, creams and socks etc which you normally get on transatlantic flights. Of course you have access to the real time TV and good selection of movies and the service is great. So I would say it is no brainer - if you can afford business class, I would only fly Jetblue Mint.",

It was awful IMHO.\nThe return flight to Boston started off on the wrong note as my brother took a tumble on an escalator. Nothing serious but medical attention was provided and we continued on to our gate where there was no place to sit!

The flight was delayed further until 330am because they could not find a pilot and first officer.\nWe then got notification two more times of delay, 555am, and again at 625am, for reasons unknown.\nWe passengers received at least 4 different excuses for the delays and then no explanation at all.\nWe passengers also went to the help desk after the 2nd or 3rd delay update, to get help as Jetblue quotes they love to help, and they were not helpful at all.\nI feel that JetBlue felt they can mistreat Bermudians (and any other passengers on board) based on the run around they gave us with this flight.\nI also feel that JetBlue didn’t want to cancel the flight in order to save money. So they opted to keep “delaying” and keep us “hostage” in the airport. Then make the suggestion, if we cancel our original flight and rebook it, we can’t change back if our original flight flies at whatever time.\nThe lowest points was having physically disabled persons sleeping on cots and then after passengers complaining for about 4 hours, the desk attendants decided to offer food vouchers around 2am!!!\nTruly a horrible experience!!!!!",

We were told that they were able to get two of the missing screws “most of the way in\" and some were still missing. They were waiting for an engineer in New York to decide whether or not the remaining missing screws “were important”???? And if the plane was safe to fly????\nThis was not exactly a comforting statement. They were waiting for someone over 2000 miles away to make a safety assessment based on what he hears from a guy standing on a platform (see pic attached) who is not close enough to screw the screws In properly let alone see them IN THE DARK. It was now 8:30pm.\nThere was a lot of screaming and yelling and hysteria at the airport gate from very scared passengers who just wanted them to cancel the flight till morning.\nAt 8:35pm ( just before the FAA’s 4 hour cutoff, where if a flight is delayed for 4 hours it must be cancelled) They decided that they were going to make the flight anyway and that it was “safe enough” to make the flight.\nJetBlue will not refund airfare or help with overnight accommodations.

Dave spoke with Eric and Chris who came over and made sure that everything I was doing with the weapons was appropriate and legal to ensure I had no issues with TSA. Everything went flawlessly smooth. This trip was booked by my employer so I asked Dave if he would be kind enough to put me in an aisle seat. When I received my ticket, I was in an aisle seat in row 1. When I boarded the plane, I was amazed at the cleanliness of the plane and the size of the seats. I was greeted by Josh the flight attendant who was very pleasant and professional. We talked quite extensively when he wasn't taking care of passengers and Josh (who resides in Boca Raton) was extremely helpful with advice on places to eat and directions around Ft. Lauderdale where I would be staying. The trip was possibly one of the smoothest and best flights I have ever had and I have flown over two hundred thousand miles on over a dozen airlines.

Lauderdale - the overall additional cost was about $100 - I was very disappointed with JetBlue. However, I am now well aware that I can cancel a part of a flight on the vacation and change it if necessary - if I had known this early on, I would have made some changes in my return from Barbados since I had an event in Orlando FL the day after my arrival home. All the other flights were fine and uneventful.",

On the flight SJU to EWR I went to the airport in the morning and got all 4 together row 6. On the return the flight was delay and they sat us on row 23. Not fair to have the option of getting seats when booking specially when I booked 3 months in advance. I would check other airlines before I book JetBlue.",

We paid extra for more legroom which would've been nice except they plopped a family including two screaming kids into our row. They were flying standby and said they didn't pay extra for the seats. I then tried to upgrade to business class as I had some work to do and there were lots of open seats, but the cost was more than my already upgraded ticket. (!) Happy to pay more, but not that much. Seemed wrong especially given the people next to us only paid coach, but all JetBlue said was too bad. So, not sure it's worth it to pay for more legroom. Instead, maybe it makes more sense to book late and you'll get that seat anyway? I am sure they will reply with some pat answer about how everyone has to pay for an upgrade but don't believe it!",

Skip to now: they were ranked the worst in the US last year by the Wall Street Journal; deservedly so. Experiences with Spirit have been better. I really don’t like writing bad reviews, check my history, but it is high time for JetBlue to be moved from the carrier of choice back to a low cost carrier where they belong. My past few trips have seen me almost miss an event due to not having a gate on landing for over an hour. Almost taking off, then not due to some kind of security emergency and then having horrible communication and delays from JetBlue at the gate as the Palm Beach bomb squad came through into the wee hours of the morning. “Dynamic” pricing changes that change when the person is on the phone and going through JetBlue’s internal system, and then not honoring the pricing they JUST told you. Not to mention the general delays that you just get used to and which they blame on ATC or working more out of the Northeast or whatever. They should have a new slogan: discount airline service at first class prices.",

Our original flight was August 31st, but with the impending storm, we felt it was cutting it too close so we sought to leave sooner. Upon arriving to the airport we find out that the Chase booking agent erroneously and nonsensically switched the departure date to September 30th instead of August 30th. So now we are left without flights, Florida is in a state of emergency and with everyone trying to get out we are told that we could possibly be Stuck up to a week - depending on how the storm affects travel. We try every other airline in the Tampa International Airport, including flying out to all airports in and near NY. No luck. Even though some of the flight prices are exceeding $1000 for a normally $300 flight - all flights are taken for days and it is anticipated that travel will cease soon. Hector and Melissa of Jet Blue see our desperation and try to arrange a flight for us out of another Florida airport the next day, which would go to a nearby NY airport. Not convenient, we have no place to stay and our car is located at a different airport in NY. However, it’s better than nothing so we contemplate taking our chances as there seems to be little hope. Feeling defeated, anxious, and uncertain about the near future, we are about to leave the airport when Hector personally reaches out and calls my cell phone to inform me of 2 seats that just came available for that night’s flight, and it’s to the NY airport where we need to be! Talk about Divine Intervention!!! Hector and Melissa are angels! They went out of the way and personally made sure that they helped us secure that flight. The airport was hectic, everyone was trying to get out. They easily could have opted to let it go and not bother following up, but they did, and because of them we are back in NY tonight with our family!!! Thank you Hector and Melissa! Thank you Jet Blue! G-d Bless you guys and praying you and your loved ones all stay safe during this crazy storm!\nWe will never forget this trip - and definitely never forget Hector and Melissa of Jet Blue inTampa! Beyond best customer service - they are sincere, caring, and professional, two gems for sure!",

     "review_text": "Generally we love flying JetBlue. However on August 22, there were some issues. There were storms in the northeast so air traffic control put a ground stop on all planes flying into the northeast. OK. I understand that. Out flight was supposed to leave at 9:26PM. The plane we were supposed to be on arrived in FLL on time and because of the ground stop was used to take a flight to Las Vegas instead of PHL. We had to wait for a plane to arrived from SJU around midnight before we could board and go to PHL. Once we boarded, we had to wait for fuel. Apparently most of the fuel workers had gone home for the night. Didn't leave until after 1AM. I will give them this though; the pilot put his foot to the floor and we made it to PHL in just about 2 hours!\nOh. And while we were waiting in the terminal the gate crew finally offered some food vouchers. Very nice. However, by the time they did this, most everything in the terminal was closed! There was one little coffee shop open with one older women working there and a line of about 50 people. Needless to say, most people never got anything to eat.\nI will continue to fly JetBlue but they missed the mark on this flight.",

The pros: it's cheap (.. but that comes with a caveat) The cons: one pays up for everything - extra baggage fees, for example - so, everybody tries to carry on as much as humanly possible and soon the overhead bins are jam-packed full and your bags are likely to get crushed and you'll be impolitely jostled by some uncaring fellow passengers struggling to get down a narrow aisle with a heavy carry-on bag, or bags (none of which they will stow in front of them under their seats!). You're gonna have to pay for extra legroom, pay up for the headphones (if there is in-flight entertainment), so you can watch a limited selection of some tired old movies. You'll have to pay extra for a meal. You have to pay extra for a beverage, and pay up for a blanket, pay up for everything! Then also, most budget carriers skimp on costs by leasing smaller gate areas and do not provide an adequate number of seats for their customers waiting in the gate area (unlike other carriers) so it's likely you will have to stand unless you are lucky enough to get to the gate early enough to actually find a seat. Budget carriers, quite simply, are seldom \"budget\".",

When we realized the flight wasn't leaving Sunday night (never informed by JetBlue vacations) I spent hours on the phone, waiting, finally rearranging, to make up for a flight that didn't take off on Sunday night. We finally got a flight Monday morning (JetBlue vacations did arrange that but only after I called them-- they never told me of any problems) and arrived in early afternoon, missing 2/3s of a day and we had to pay for the first night to keep our room (or else we were told we would have no room). Along the way an apparently helpful JetBlue Vacations agent got us a new flight (and told us the seats) but I later discovered we had no seat albeit a very helpful Jet Blue Mosaic agent was able to get us seats -- but interestingly we couldn't get our boarding passes on our apps but the helpful JetBlue Mosaic agent was able to get us registered etc -- thank you JetBlue Mosaic, shame on you JetBlue Vacations.

THE SERVICES IN NASSAU FOR JET BLUE IS A DISGRACE!\nCustomer must be very vigilant and make their job because they are not capable.\nTherefore because the flight of jet blue was late 1hour and 30 mn in Nassau (as usual)\nI missed my connexion from New York. From this point my nightmare began. I had to wait 3 hours in a queue to be directed on another flight. I paid a total of $1500 for the flight from nassau to Doha with a stop in JFK New york. I paid to have the Qatar airways services, but at the end I was flying on Aeroflot, which doesn't offer at all the same standards and services than Qatar. Alone in the Airport of JFK at midnight, I actually did take whatever they had for me to leave this awful and dirty airport. They found me a flight on Aeroflot, I had to pay an extra for my seat (exit seat) 80$ when i have already paid the same on Qatar. The shame!\nBut this is not the end of the nightmare, is only the beginning. When i arrived in Beiruth in lebanon my final destination, they announced me that they lost my luggage. They couldn’t not tell me where my luggage was, obviously because the lady at Nassau airport did not give me a tracking number on my luggage as any other flight company does!! I spent my week holidays without any of belongings, luckily, I had two clean underwear with me that I had to wash by hand the time to buy new ones. I was going to the wedding of my closest friend. This wedding was planned a year before and I purchased my tickets 6 months in advance. Unfortunately, I COULD NOT WEAR MY WEDDING DRESS THAT I SPENT 200$ FOR THIS SPECIAL MOMENT. The day of the wedding I had to spend three hours to fill up papers to search for my luggage at the beiruth airport, but I couldn’t not find it. JET BLUE MESSED UP MY ENTIRE STAY, IT WAS A NIGHTMARE AND I WILL NEVER FLY WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN!",

I'm not gonna go into detail about the things everyone already knows they have like the amazing amenity kits, the great in flight entertainment, or the always amazing food options. What I will say is that jetblue is always the way to go because whether you are flying by yourself or with someone you know there will always be a seating option for you. I traveled with 2 friends so one friend had a seat all to himself with his own door and i sat next to my other friend. JetBlue has a specific concierge for mint and mosaic passengers that is always amazing. And when you're by your baggage claim I have never once seen our bags not come out first. I can't wait for their routes to europe to open up so i can fly with them their too.",

     "review_text": "I have always been a big fan of Jet Blue Airlines. I appreciate the planes, the service, the amount of legroom provided on even the basic seats, and I like the one class of service and the in-flight entertainment.\nI have always hoped Jet Blue would add a couple of healthier options to their snack offerings, such as a Kind or protein bar or an unsalted trail mix. I am still waiting, but clearly, this is not a huge deal. I can bring my own snacks. I am disappointed that they recently removed the small \"pod\" sized bottles of water from the beverage choices and replaced it with a cup of bottled water. I liked the ability to replace the cap, hence enabling me to drink it at my leisure during the flight.\nThe most attractive part of the Jet Blue experience is individual TVs with in-flight television, movies, and music. This system failed me on both legs of my last trip on the airline just last week. On the outbound flight, my TV was very static-filled and virtually impossible to view. Fortunately, the seat next to me was unoccupied so I watched from one seat over. It was not the most comfortable viewing situation, but it was better than nothing. I did not want to physically change seats as the person in the seat over from that one would not have been pleased losing the seat between us; neither would I have appreciated losing the extra space. On the return, my TV was stuck on one channel, the Jet Blue channel, so I had no ability to watch at all.\nI notified Jet Blue after the flights about my experience and the \"remedy\" was to put $15 for each of the two legs of transit in my Jet Blue bank. So now I have a whopping $30 of Jet Blue money. How that helps exactly, I am unsure. There really is no way for them to make it right, but an impersonal form email letter telling me the resolution surely was not the answer. At least an assurance that the TVs would be serviced, would have been welcomed. I would have given a 5-star customer service rating if not for this \"solution\" to the above TV issue.\nAs usual, the majority of the flight staff were pleasant and the flight was on-time and we arrived at our destinations safely, which is most important, of course. Jet Blue remains one of the best domestic airlines available.",

No other flight options available.\nWithin 20 minutes there and speaking to customer service for a resolution or alternative options as I had to get back home because my children were to begin their first day of school today. The rep simply said other than flying into JFK New York on the next available flight which was an hour and a half later on my expense there was nothing they could do.\nHe advised it was best to wait it out as they were not going to reimburse. E nor provided transportation from NY to NJ had I chose to go on the next available flight.\nMeanwhile it was 8pm and the original scheduled flight still was in New Jersey.\nFinally another update as announced there would be another aircraft sent. Apologies for the delay but the flight would leave by 10:47pm instead of 9:32pm.\nI was howpful because it meant I would still sake it home in time for my kids to go to school for their first day. No more announcements/ updates, simply beverages and chips for the inconvenience were handed out.\nAt 10:17, an announcement is made the f,isn't would be arriving at 1:17am! So after more than 4 hours in airport flight arrives and we arrive to Newark airport at 4:47am!!\nNo care or proper customer service was displayed by Jet Blue.",

I like to have my movies on a screen in front of me, like Delta has, but American does not. Jetblue had this. Though we were in economy, the leg room was ample in all the rows. My husband is 6'1\" and is a big man. He had plenty of room. I hate having to ask for drinks, snacks etc because I feel like Oliver Twist begging for more porridge (though the ticket prices don't reflect this!!). Jetblue passes out snacks and drinks, as much as you want (!!!) and then puts everything in a fridge/cupboard in the center of the plane and invites all passengers to help themselves if they'd like another snack or beverage! It's about time an airline realizes that those of us in economy class would like to be treated like human beings as well!! One of the flight attendants, Don, let a little boy help him collect the trash because the child asked if he could. Don said \"of course!\". One passenger tipped this little boy $5 and he accidentally threw it in the trash bag but didn't realize that until he finished his job. Don went through the entire bag to find the $5 bill!!! Where were the surly, exhausted, rude and absent flight attendants?? Not on Jetblue! They were all so friendly and professional. Now that we're hooked, we will try to find Jetblue flights because the service was just so incredible. I do hope it's like this again, because for the first time since 9/11, I ENJOYED flying!!",

Over the last year, that has drastically changed. Jetblue and their consistent delays, have now become a common joke. It isn't \"if\" there will be a delay, it is \"when\". Airlines are expected to encounter delays from time to time, due to weather, or mechanical issues, which is entirely understandable. Jetblue however, has far exceeded the norm. There are clearly ongoing issues, that have not been corrected or addressed within their company, that now cause every single flight to have multiple delays. It is a waste of time and money to their customers. If you want to enjoy a seamless flight and not have hours and hours worth of delays, do NOT fly with Jetblue until they address and resolve their internal issues.",

They are close to what was once the great airlines in the U.S.A.-Pan Am and TWA. For me their customer service has always above and beyond. Yes I am one of their MOSAIC individuals; but, I am also a crew member for a competitor and have always been treated with respect and professionalism from the Flight Attendants and the Gate Agents, especially in Pittsburgh. I have only had one negative experience with them and it involved a Captain who obviously was a new Captain and wanted to prove his position of importance.

That 15 min. turned into an hour and then after waiting nearly 3 hours, we were told the flight has been cancelled due to maintenance. They arranged 4 buses for all the stranded passengers to take us to a hotel, they didn't tell us where we were goin until we were on the bus. My family and I boarded the 3rd bus and was taken to Brickell Bay Aruba, which is a horrible hotel. There was no way I was going to end my vacation staying there when we spent a week at the Hyatt Beach Resort & Casino. Unfortunately the Hyatt was completely booked so we ended up at the Hilton which Hyatt arranged for us. At check-in we noticed people from our flight there. We were so upset because they got the Hilton and we got some hole in the wall hotel. Anyways to make a long story short we stayed and ate dinner at the Hilton. The manager informed us to keep our receipts and JetBlue should reimburse you.When I called JetBlue a supervisor informed me that there is nothing she could do about it because we didn't stay where they placed us. Not acceptable. How is being inconvenienced a whole day my fault, they need a better customer service team , its like they aren't human enough to care. what a joke",

     "review_text": "I made my reservation for this flight about 2 months before my expected travel date. Two weeks before I am supposed to fly out for my best friends wedding, I check my travel via the JetBlue app. The flight showed it was still confirmed, and everything was fine, but then I went to look into my seat assignment and was shocked. The flight was CANCELLED. I never received an email telling me my flight was cancelled and NOWHERE on the app did it tell me it was cancelled until I had to dig for more information.\nAfter this I called JetBlue to understand how this happened since I did NOT make any changes to this booking and just wanted to see how this happened and re-book my travel. I called and spoke with Tiffany, and she told me she had no idea how this happened. And then went back and forth with her supervisor Michelle to see if they knew why my reservation was magically cancelled. After about 5 minutes on hold i was told that someone must have logged into my account and cancelled it. Which I did not believe because I never cancelled this flight.\nI was then told my Tiffany that they would be willing to re-book my flight at the original cost, which sounded okay at first. But I asked how this happened in the first place and what would have happened if I didn't call in today. They told me it was essentially not their fault at all and that I was essentially to blame. I asked if they could give me any sort of upgrade or make this up to me in any way, which Tiffany told me her supervisor would not allow. I asked to speak to her supervisor then.\nI spoke to Michelle, who took zero accountability for what had happened. I know she did not cancel my booking, but something happened and it was cancelled and she was unwilling to work with me at all. She was extremely rude to me and kept asking for my credit card number, and I refused to give it to her until I had some sort of apology, which she refused to do.\nI then told Michelle that I have flown over 100 flights in the past few years for work and have never received this type of treatment from any airline employee. She did not care. I then said that I have the option to fly with other airlines, and that I would never fly with JetBlue again. Once again, she did not care about that and told me she could do it at the same rate. I then finally advised her I would not be booking with JetBlue and will be going with a different airline. I then mentioned that I would write a review about this interaction and advise all my colleagues and peers to never fly with JetBlue.\nOverall, I have never been disregarded as a person like this before. And from a customer service standpoint this is unacceptable. I urge you all to be cautious when dealing with this company as they will never get my business and I encourage nobody else to deal with them in the future.",

The single seats are the same price as the double seats so...\nHonestly, the only complaint that I have is on the menu. The menu looked very good but all of the dish options had dairy in them, the dessert choices all had dairy, and the breakfast was stuffed with dairy. Since I am lactose intolerant, there was nothing that I could eat on the flight. There was fruit on the menu but when I spoke to the flight attendant about the food she didn't offer fruit so I believe that they didn't have any at the time. I paid a lot of money for this flight and was unable to eat because the choices weren't diverse enough.",

     "review_text": "July 2019 - My daughter-in-law and grandson flew direct from Sacramento, Ca to Boston, Mass. Checked in two suitcases at the exact same moment. Grandsons suitcase never made it to Boston on a DIRECT FLIGHT. They couldn't find it. They'll call us. Well, it is a 2 1/2 hour drive ONE WAY. You'll need to do better than call. We had to stop and buy a bathing suit, couple changes of clothes, summer foot wear, personal care things etc. Many phone calls and we find out it went to Bosco Bay or similar in CA. It will be in Boston in 2 days when my son arrives. Oh good. My sons stuff was packed in there too as he was coming right from a job. NOT! 3 hours of searching for it and nada. It supposedly went to MEXICO and came back to Boston via United and was in United's baggage claim. Nope. So, now my son has no clothing except what's on his back. Another stop to buy stuff for him to wear. More phone calls. Lots of BS and run around by the people on the phone. Finally, 6 DAYS LATER we get a call \"Come get your bag we have it\". WHAT!!! No way you get it to us. Ok, now we are in the hands of a delivery company that has a 1 star rating and does not care AT ALL about their service. They say they will delivery the bag between...3 am and 7 am on a Sunday. WHAT!!! Never have I heard of anything like that. We are on an island so we had to sit in a car in the parking lot waiting for the bag to be delivered. It did not come. They ended up getting a tracking number and found out the bag never even left Boston until after 9 am. It finally arrived at 1 pm! The delivery phone person was the rudest, non professional person we have ever dealt with. The suitcase was intact is the only good message of this saga. Moral of the story. Jet Blue looses baggage often and on direct flights. Jet Blue does not find the lost luggage quickly and does not keep track of it once found. Jet Blue does not hire reliable delivery companies to return the luggage that you paid for and they lost. As far as the flight was concerned. It was an over nighter and they had no complaints. Oh we agree with Kathryn H. They have perfected the apathetic customer service agents.",

     "review_text": "Our flight was delayed for hours and the deplaned due to mechanical issues. Yes, safety comes first. The problem I have with JetBlue, there was not any urgency expressed to get us home. Our flight was suppose to land in Atlanta on Sunday, August 4th at 11:45pm. On top of that we had to go through customs all over again because they took us to a hotel until the next morning for the next available flight. Therefore, we had to go through the check in process over again. To say the least, this was a terrible experience. I am a frequent flyer and have never experience treatment like this. The flight was delayed the next morning. They could not give us a reason as to why the flight kept getting delayed. When we got to FT. Lauderdale, Florida, our flight was delayed there too. We made it to Atlanta at 1:15 Tuesday morning. I see being delayed a few hours but a day and some. And when was asked how we would be compensated, we were told $150 credit towards your next flight. My husband and I had to call out from work on Monday. So we missed a day of work, an extra day we had to may for a dog sitter and we had to pay to uber to get our car because shuttle service stops at 12:50. So, I wrote JetBlue and hoping they would respond in a timely manner. Like I said no urgency. I wrote to them on 8-5-19 and they said to give there compensation team 10 days. Well today is 8-19-19 and I still have not heard from them. They provide this link for you to check the status that does not work.",

Both with the delay notification and cancelation. So that we could have planned ahead.\nAfter which we waited in line an hour at the customer service desk since the entire flight needed to reschedule. Which they could not, until 2 days later. The customer service rep did inform us however that we could refund our ticket simply by calling jetBlue. Which was completely incorrect, as we were transferred around a few times only to given a 25% travel voucher. Which as you can imagine I’m in no hurry to utilize.

Started out very rocky, HORRIBLE airport, flight delayed by hours, so not happy!!! OMG, once we boarded, the leg room was heaven. Comfortable seats, delightful staff/attendants. Long comfortable flight. I recommend solely based on leg room and flight attendants! Now, flying home from other country was another story. Rude employees at airport. Board plane and thankful for exact attendants we had 8 days earlier. What are the odds? Overall, fun, comfortable flying!",

Even worse, the flight got cancelled altogether, forcing us to hedge our bets\nbetween re-booking—or flying a different carrier, which we did, because we were now a day late to our tour! Returning back from Quito, we were delayed and cancelled AGAIN. This time, our re-booked flight back into Ft Lauderdale was TWO DAYS LATER! As a courtesy, we were put up at a nice airport hotel, and given coupons for future travel. Nice gesture, but unfortunately I will not be flying with this airline again.",

     "review_text": "I was flying from Fort Lauderdale(FLL) to NYC(JFK) on July 31st, 2019. The flight was scheduled to leave at 8:36 PM and arrive at JFK at roughly 11:36 PM. It was supposed to be a simple flight that I had made many times before. The morning of the flight, I checked the flight status and it said it was delayed to depart FLL at 11:10 PM and arrive at JFK at 2:07 AM. This was a big problem because I had a connecting international flight from another airline that was scheduled to leave JFK on-time at 2:30 AM. I was shocked and Jetblue website did not explain why it was delayed. I figured I would go to the airport early so I could get on another flight to NYC. After I arrived and waited in line for customer service, I talked to a Jetblue representative about the situation. He said he could get me and my family on another flight leaving to JFK at 8:30 PM that was delayed from 2:00 PM that afternoon. He claimed there were seats on it. However, he began to go on his phone for 20 minutes. Then, he seemed to make a call but never actually said a word. This continued for nearly 50 minutes because he finally broke the news to us that this flight was completely sold out and the next available flight was next morning. I don’t know when this flight was sold out or if it was sold out when he told us there were seats on it. I don’t know what he was doing on his phone for over an hour but I was frustrated as I could’ve gone to another airline to but another ticket. However, it was too late and all flights to JFK that would have allowed me to catch my connecting flight were gone because I had wasted my time with Jetblue customer service which ended up doing nothing for me. I asked the representative why flights were being delayed and he said there were thunderstorms in NYC. I checked the departure screens afterwards and it seemed that only Jetblue flights were delayed. No other airlines were delayed. I also called my family in NYC and they said there was no inclement weather the entire day. I started to question Jetblue’s honesty and transparency. With no other choice, I had to go along with my original flight and figure out the situation when I arrived to JFK. At around 11 PM, the gate agent for Jetblue announced that the flight was going to be delayed for 30 more minutes because of weather. After 20 more minutes, he announced that the flight was going to be delayed until 12 AM because there was no pilot for the plane. Everyone waiting was frustrated. Finally, at a little over midnight, we were allowed to board the plane. Before taxing out, the pilot actually walked out to the aisle and said to us that he didn’t even know he was supposed to be working and that he was at home watching TV when he got a call. Does Jetblue not organize or plan which flights have pilots? Or do they just get a random pilot last minute before the flight was going to leave? I was shocked at his announcement. When we finally go to JFK at 2:45 AM, my connecting flight had already left. I talked to the customer service of that airline and they said they were able to rebook me on a different flight that left that afternoon if I was able to obtain confirmation of the delayed flight from Jetblue so it was determined it was something out of my control. So I waited at the customer service for Jetblue at JFK for them to open and was able to talk to another representative. I explained the situation and she said that she was unable to give me any confirmation of any sort of how my flight to JFK from FLL was delayed. I explained to her that it was requested from a different airline and she outright said they were lying because that is a ridiculous thing to ask. I was lost at words because it seemed as if the staff only chooses what to believe if it was convenient for them. Moments later, an employee who I assumed was the supervisor came out and told me to vacate the premises because I was causing a disruption. I never raised my voice and was being polite the entire time! He claimed I was making things up and there was nothing else he could do for me. I had to go back to the other airline and tell them what had happened. Their customer service ended up calling the Jetblue customer service and regarding the delayed flight. However, they were able to sort it out and get me on the next flight out of JFK to my next destination. The amount of unprofessionalism, dishonesty, disregard for customers, and downright rudeness I have experienced from Jetblue in less than 12 hours was insane. There is absolutely no transparency or accountability towards customers from this organization. I will never be flying them again.",

Initially this flight was delayed, however, around 10pm we were allowed to board. Almost everyone was settled in their seats when we were directed to deplane bc there was no pilot! For the next 4 hours, the flight continued to be delayed while we received updates that they were still in search of a pilot (ridiculous!). The flight was finally cancelled around 2am! At that time we were informed that we all (a full flight) needed to go to customer service to be re-booked. Customer service was understaffed (2 people for a line of about 100), so I called the 1-800 # while in line and was able to get my family booked on the next flight. However, while in line, we were informed that there would be no hotel or food vouchers given for the inconvenience, so my family (including a newborn) \"slept\" at JFK that night. The next flight was delayed also and all of these delays caused us to miss our connecting flight in Trinidad with Caribbean Airlines, so once we arrived there, we were placed on standby and didn't get to our final destination of Tobago until 2am Friday morning. We were supposed to arrive at the resort at 7am on Thursday morning! I will NEVER fly your airline again and will be sure to let everyone I know about my experience. Absolutely disgraceful JetBlue!",

I understand this to a point but when they told us this on Thursday when we missed our connecting and that we couldn’t get on a flight until Saturday at 8:40pm it makes you a little angry. Yes I was on vacation but the reason we decided to come home when we did was so we could go back to work, what you normally do when you come back from spending all your money. So when we were told we would have to stay in Boston because they couldn’t figure out anything else for us when I asked about other places to fly to and options, there response is well if we fly you to Chicago can you find your own transportation home? Chicago to msp, um no, I was suggesting that you fly us to Chicago and get us in a connecting flight from Chicago to msp. They also wouldn’t pay for our hotel stay because “the original reason for missing your flight was because of weather”, the weather happened on Wednesday we flew on Thursday. The only reason they get two stars is because the lady we dealt was nice and “tried” her best, not sure she really tried. The next morning we decided to fly standby and when I asked the gate agent some questions her responses were straight rude. I am in the customer service agency and if I was rude like that to anyone I wouldn’t have a job. I was never rude to any of them because I understand they get cranky, bitchy people all the time but it’s different when you aren’t doing that to them and they are still rude back to you. I’d rather pay extra for a different company then fly with them again, because I’d most likely miss a flight again, with no bad weather, and they’d blame it on the weather. They also are pretty unprofessional on the help desks, in the middle of helping us they lady we had and the other girls working the desk were full on conversations about things other than work, I just wanted to be helped and able to go to sleep somewhere instead we stood there for an hour an a half.",

     "review_text": "Up until this flight I was a loyal JetBlue customer. No more. After boarding the flight and having us sit around for an hour or so they disembarked us and said there was a simple sensor that needed to be fixed. On an hourly basis they said the problem was going to be resolved. The 10:58 am flight finally took off at 8:30 pm. The level of either incompetence or of deception was extraordinary even in these days where poor performance is expected. It was as if the airline did not want us to cancel and switch to another airline irrespective of the inconvenience to the passenger. Everyone involved in this clear deception did so with a pleasant smile on their face which leads me to conclude the reason for the delay was incompetence rather than deception.\nWe finally decide to pay for a very expensive last minute ticket to an alternate airport that was closer to our destination. Now catch this. Even though a $250 payment was promised per the passenger bill of rights, since we were delayed over 8 hours, if you cancelled your reservation even at the last minute to get on an alternate flight you would lose the payment. So we got a new ticket but did not cancel the old ticket since the payment would exceed the ticket cost.\nWe have had several severe delays on JetBlue recently. The latest 8 hours to fix a sensor was the last straw. Clearly this is a severe management problem. Maintenance is not up to the challenge of flying the heck out of these planes and clearly the airport staff has not been taught how to value customers and treat them honestly.\nGoodby JetBlue you were a good friend but have lost your way.",

The flight was scheduled to leave Atlanta at 6:30 AM on Saturday morning. Given that we live out of state over 2 hours away, we decided to drive down on Friday and stay the night at a hotel to be able to be at the airport 3 hours before our international flight at 3:30 AM. At 8:30 PM I received an email that stated our flight was cancelled and JetBlue was looking into options. At 9:00 PM we received another email that required us to rebook, less than 10 hours before departure. After receiving the cancellation email just 6 hours before we were supposed to leave for the airport. I called JetBlue and was on hold for over 30 minutes of asking why the flight was cancelled (no response given), and how we were to get our money back, along with a $200 change fee we were charged to book the flight in the first place. The representative became frustrated and hung up on me. I called back (now an hour later) and had to wait on hold again for 30 more minutes. When I got a hold of the next representative, she informed me that all she could do was give me a voucher. I asked to speak with a supervisor, and he told me to email all this information to this email. At this point, it was close to 10:45 PM, and we had no choice but to book a new flight. Flights to Grand Cayman were now (hours before day of departure) over $1000/person (we paid $118/person originally). After numerous conversations and request for compensation, we’ve received no help. The last thing I need is a travel voucher for an airline that I don't ever intend to fly again.",

It soon became a mass crowd of tired, uniformed and restless travelers. A fist fight almost occurred, with no one intervening. With 6 counters available, only three were manned and the line increasing got longer and longer. The plane arrived late and take off was delayed. Thankfully we checked our carry-ons at the gate because the overheads quickly were consumed.The icing on the cake were the dirty seats (literally can see the grime on the back of the chairs) and the entertainment monitor not working. When the attendant was informed, she told me to find an empty seat knowing the plane was full. Yes, I was to find an empty seat, not her, but me. The flight attendants were caught rolling their eyes and sighing when a traveler made a request. Total lack of customer service - JetBlue do you even have customer service training? I am hoping this was an isolated incident. If not, JetBlue needs to reevaluate their efficiency, productivity and customer service.",

It’s always a very comfortable flight for adults and kids with great entertainment (including Sirius XM) and the meal selections and red eye packages are favorites when needed. The best part is their employees. The few pilots I’ve spoken to were polite and cordial, but 99% of the flight attendants are personable, engaging, and don’t get rattled by things that don’t matter. When we plan a trip, we always see if jetBlue flys there first. ♥️✈️",

When the flight continued to be delayed, we realized we were going to miss our connection in Boston, traveling to Iceland. When someone finally appeared at the JetBlue desk, we were told not to worry, they would change our tickets to a later flight on Icelandic Air. The staffer said it would take some time as their computers were \"not compatible \" with Icelandic Air. We left Charlotte 2 hours late, and missed our original connecting flight in Boston. However, when we went to check in on the later flight, we found we were not on the passenger list for Icelandic Air. It was now almost midnight. We found the last two agents left at the JetBlue desk and had to insist they fix the problem. I think they were ready to go home and weren't very happy to have to untangle this problem, created in Charlotte. However, they eventually got us on the flight to Iceland.

Our last trips have been delayed departing on average 2.5 hours. As I write this review my girl is delayed coming back down to Florida AGAIN!!!\nNow I get they can’t control the weather and other things but doesn’t seem to delay any of the other airlines that are going on and out go figure.... plus we got the Jetblue credit card rang up a whopping 15k plus for our wedding and that doesn’t get you anywhere point exchange sucks so that’s going bye bye.\nOh did I mention that the TVs don’t work and their WiFi is at best spotty. Guess the only good thing to say is the attendants and pilots are ok but time to switch back to old faithful that being southwest. Guess I never should have changed up but that’s life GIVE the other guy a shot. You don’t even get a voucher for your inconvenience or how about hey bud this drinks on me.

They cancelled my flight that it was supposed to departure at 9:31am and let me know less than hour and half before. I was already at the airport and they re-schedule the flight for 8:45pm. The other flight that was available at 12:45pm was over booked so I was not able to get in the flight until 8:45pm. I had to waited all that time and the operator( customer service) and counter ladies were not able to help me. Unfortunately, Jet Blue does not has contracts with other airplane companies so they can not help you to find a flight with another company. Really dissapointed. Never again will buy flights to Jet Blue unless the company re-organizes their logistics and get more airplanes for sitiatiosn like this.

They took care of us very well with snacks, drinks, anything we needed.

Let me start by saying, JetBlue, that you have some of the rudest staff I've met in a long time and might I add, ignorant?\nJetBlue cancelled a number of flights to Florida due to inclement weather or in my case, \"due to unforeseen events\" without really notifying anyone that the flight had been cancelled. The line for cancelled flights was horrendous, but that was only the tip of the iceberg.\nOne of the JetBlue managers, in his infinite wisdom, decided to break up one of the lines and yelled that \"you can either wait in line with 400 people or 200 people\" meaning the line I was in would be at the back end of the 200 people. He didn't even tell customers where this other imaginary line was. Meanwhile, other agents were trying to discourage customers to stay in line because they didn't want to give any vouchers for hotels or food.\nJetBlue transferred me to a flight out of Westchester County airport for the following day without even asking if it was acceptable as I was in JFK. Plus, they stuck me in a middle seat and I can't even it change it online without their charging $50 for an extra legroom seat which isn't what I wanted. I just wanted an aisle or window seat.\nWhen I approached a JetBlue customer service agent about the possibility of getting a voucher for the shuttle I needed to get to Westchester County and a hotel, she promptly walked away.\nOne of the transport people, while probably not a JetBlue employee, told me to take the AirTrain to Westchester County. Seriously? Souburbia argued with me stating \"Mama, you asked me about flights,\" which I did not! Nor was I her Mama.\nI've had to take a shuttle to Westchester County and stay at a hotel close to the airport for the possibility of getting on a non-stop flight to Fort Myers tomorrow!\nAre you going to compensate me JetBlue for the nearly $300 I'm spending on hotel, shuttle van and then another cab to the Westchester County airport? I think not!\nI won't fly JetBlue again and will tell others the same! Time to get your staff sorted out, JetBlue, and help them understand what true customer service is all about!!

Being that I was traveling alone, booked my aisle seat months ago, I was still in boarding group E which is the very last group. Even though I checked in 24 hours before my flight, there is no alternative to being in group E. This meant that I had to check my bag in at the gate because they were afraid that there would be no space in the overhead. After boarding, I noticed that there were still a lot of space.

The trip home was a nightmare beginning at the airport. I contacted Jetblue at 1-800 Jetblue on August 1st, 2019 to make sure I could fly our Mahi Mahi home on the plane, and how it needed to be packaged to fly. We followed directions to a T. Got to the airport and was told by the agents working there that we could not fly our fish home. Jetblue does not allow flying fish internationally. No where in their rules and regulations does it say that you can’t fly fish home to the USA or Internationally. They confiscated our newly purchased cooler loaded with frozen fish. We were told however that we could fly the empty cooler home for $40.00. REALLY? I contacted Jetblue when I got home and was told by Holly (CRO) that there shouldn’t have been a problem. She would check on it and someone would call me right back. It has been two days with no phone call so I picked up the phone and called back to Jetblue, and received information from a supervisor that we were not allowed to fly the fish back. Costa Rica is a big fishing destination and jetblue doesn’t fly fish back! All other airlines coming out of Costa Rica will fly the fish back. Please know that if you are going to Costa Rica to fish and plan on keeping your fish to bring home , “DO NOT FLY JETBLUE! Pay a little bit more for your ticket and fly either Delta or American Airlines. Very disappointed in airlines teaching rules and regulations to their employees especially those employees handling phone calls about the rules and regulations.",

In the end I would never, never in my life recommend BlueJet to someone. The service, attitude of the crew, and efficiency of JetBlue is horrible.

They told us due to a new policy, we could not check it in our luggage or carry it on the plane. It would have to be left in Boston.\nWe appealed to the supervisor who showed us on page 9 of the purchase agreement on the website, where the new rule was. Who gets to page 9?!? Then she said it was actually a TSA requirement but we checked with TSA who stated it was allowed by them. JetBlue also said that we couldn’t sign a waiver to relinquish rights to the condition of the food when we landed. So here we were at Logan Airport at 5AM, an hour and a half away from home with no way to get it there. $300+ of meat and a nice cooler bag lost.\nVery disappointed in JetBlue’s lack of communication of this new rule AND lack of appeal/waiver recourse!",

The changes messed up my entire schedule and caused many complications. I had roaming enabled on my phone through Sprint (costs $0.25/minute), calls with JetBlue until they admitted that they made the changes totaled 3.5 hours ($52.50) and they still had the audacity to ask me for a \"penalty\" fee when I called to change my reservation to a much sooner date.\nHow a small-time regional carrier is messing with international-traveler' schedules is beyond me.

At the terminal, one couldn't go ten minutes without hearing, \"This flight is moved to gate [x], please move.\" Once they told passengers to move to a new gate, then a minute later told them it was a mistake and they should stay. Rather than being upfront about how long a delay would last, they gradually changed from a 6:30 PM departure to 7:45, 9:10, and finally 9:50. We finally got on the plane just before 10, but didn't take off until around 11:15. The pilot kept saying they expected to leave in 10-20 minutes and giving false excuses when all the while anyone on a flight tracker website could see it wouldn't take off until past 11. The stewardesses didn't hesitate to badger anyone about seatbelts, luggage, and phone use while the plane was grounded. The televisions were of poor quality. I would not recommend this airline to anybody.",

Shortly before leaving for the airport to check in we received two messages from JetBlue that our flight was delayed. This was a concern as we had a tight connection in Boston. I called the airline and at that time they had seats to move us to a later Boston flight but felt it wasn’t yet necessary to move us.\nOnce we got to the airport and checked in, it was a big problem that they had not moved us—now we not only would miss our connection but the second flight was also full. And the next flight would mean almost a 12 hours layover-UG!\nSo we asked—where else in South Florida does JetBlue have a flight going to anytime soon? Turned out, a direct flight to Lauderdale was leaving 20 minutes after our initial flight and there were seats. The agent promptly booked us on that flight. We had to juggle our car rental reservation but the two airports are only about 40-50 minutes apart. So worth it to get our day back AND not have a connection.\nBut the key was to ask!\nI cannot remember the agents name but he was super helpful. Everything went smoothly from there. Very happy with both the communication from the first delay moving forward and the efforts extended by the JetBlue team.",

I volunteered my bag.\nAccording to the JetBlue, the gate agent should have told me to remove all electronics from the bag before checking it at the end of the jetway. I was not told this, so I checked my bag with my iPad.\nUpon seating, I did see that there was space above my seat. But since I already gate checked my bag...the point was mute.\nOn arrival at JFK...my bag did not show up. I immediately went to the JetBlue baggage office and reported a missing bag. I showed them my baggage claim check and they processed the claim.\nThe first five days from JetBlue I got the same message. 'We have not located your bag but we will let you know as soon as we find it\". After 5 days, you can file a claim and we will consider the bag lost after 30 days.\nOn the third day, I got the usual call. But this time I made a request to redirect the bag to my home since I was leaving early. The JetBlue rep said \"call us in the morning when you have left NYC\". Seriously..you're on the phone now and if you found the bag I don't want it heading here when I'm heading to the airport. Then I told her \"OK I'VE LEFT\". Then she said \"ok I'll make believe you left and redirect your bag\". Like she was doing me a favor....wow unbelievable\nThey expected me to have a receipt for the items in my bag. Oh wow...I always itemize everything in my suitcase and have a receipt before I go on vacation...SERIOUSLY NO\nWell...its been over 30 days, but along the way these are the things that happened:\n- They said electronics will not be covered...WHY??? Nobody told me to remove them!\n- They will only pay a portion of the value...WHY??? I can't replace my items for a portion of the price!\n- I got a call from a JetBlue rep to handle my case started the process then stopped returning my calls and/or electronic communications.\n- Nobody the JetBlue can tell me what will be paid...WHY??? I was told you will know when the process is over...REALLY? What does that mean\n- JetBlue rep said \"the rules are set by Federal Rules\"...REALLY, Those are minimums not what you should do. IT IS NOT AGAINST THE LAW TO DO MORE THAN MINIMUM!\n...now waiting on JetBlue.",

Sorry, I’ve never been on a plane where they go up and down the aisle hawking their different wares at different times. Every other airline I’ve flown has 1 cart with everything and you don’t have to wait for the “doorbuster” announcements. Anyway, it was clear none of the attendants wanted to be there.\nTHEN on the flight home, 494 on 7/18/19, the DENVER airport (DIA) jetBlue employees were lovely and friendly and ready to help with a smile but then again, step on the plane & that Boston-based rudeness kicked in again. The stewardess who served my drink actually shook her head at me because I apparently took too long with my apple pay because she held the reader too far away from me and angled away from me and I ended up having to pull it to me and then needed to unlock it with my face which p'd her off causing the incredibly rude SMH moment. Unbelievable.\nThe seats were comfortable though and for that reason alone, we will fly jb again…and will know ahead next time not to expect manners if were are flying from Logan. Only two stars because comfort doesn't matter if you don't enjoy the flight because of the help.",

No refund is offered only the option of waiting 2 hours for possibly another flight at 11:45 (midnight) when asking the flight attendant if I’m able to cancel my flight and get my baggage they wouldn’t allow It, they told me I have to collect them in Long Beach as they were not unpacking the luggage from the aircraft.

Half the time, it's not working and when they are, I might as well use my graphing calculator because that has better graphics.\nThe staff at JFK is consistently and without a fault, rude. I understand, it's a mad house of a place any time of the day so maybe they're also stressed out. For a relatively new terminal, it has not aged well and it's just not a good place to be. The help desk that are supposed to be...well...helping people...are always under staffed.\nThe snacks and drinks are sub standard, for an airline who keeps bragging about their snack selection, it's really not that special.\nOnboard crew is mediocre. I've had better and more memorable service on United and American than JetBlue. The only redeeming quality is that their cockpit crew are often very friendly and chatty.\nBeing based on the East Coast, it's hard to avoid JetBlue. But how the mighty have fallen - on top of it, they have atrocious on-time performance and they always blame it on weather when there's not a cloud in the sky either at the origin, destination, or wherever the plane is coming from.\nBest part of JetBlue though?

The staff at the airport had to announce to disregard JetBlue’s notifications. The plane arrived and we boarded. We waited 20 minutes after everyone boarded, then they announced that they missed there opportunity to take off and also couldn’t find a pilot to fly across country! Wow. We had to deplane. They then delayed the flight again. This time for 3:45pm the next day! This would be a total delay time of almost 16 hours! Totally incompetent and unacceptable. To make matters worse, they didn’t even offer a flight voucher or compensation of any kind for their screw up. I’m never taking this airline again.",

Absolutely infuriating how this company operates. Terrible, terrible, terrible and will never be flying jet blue again.

On checking today to manage flight, only to realize that the trip was cancelled by the airline, based on their incorrect assumption that the purchase was fraud. The airlines was contacted nothing they could do except refund the money which would take time.The ticket now had to be purchase with cash. I spoke to customer service, even a supervisor, informed that there was more than 7 seats left. Money was sent in the form of US dollars to pay for the tickets, only to find that the seats were all gone and the fare had to not double to over $400 per person costing an extra $600 Canadian dollars.\nThis shows very poor and distasteful customer service, inept staff.

What you are not told by JetBlue is that they are booking you in an Iceland Air fare class called \"Economy Light\", which does not include a checked bag. You are not given a choice on this. And you won't even discover this fee until you are standing at the counter at JFK. At no point during JetBlue's online booking process are you ever asked about baggage (or seat selection for that matter).\nIceland Air will tell you it's JetBlue's problem, and Iceland Air makes it kind of a process to even pay for the bag. It's hard to imagine this is standard practice. But be forewarned that you will be charged for baggage. It may be advisable to book directly through Iceland Air, where you will be presented with a choice of fare class (and seat selection).",

She got us scheduled for a return the next day, connecting in Florida. We paid the fees for cancelling as well as the price difference for the new flights and she sent me the forms to ask for a waiver. I filled out the information and within a few days, Jet Blue deposited both the fees and price difference in our Travel Bank.We have that money available for one year from today on any booking through Jet Blue directly.\nJet Blue truly is an airline with heart and compassion!

There are only 3 movies, one being for the kids. The buttons on our return trip didn't work and required maintenance.

In other cases, it depended on which of the conflicting stories you believed. But my (additional) complaints are (i) how the staff handled the flight once we boarded, and (ii) the condition of the equipment. The staff were either silent and uninvolved or nasty, impatient and intimidating, inciting other passengers to turn their anger toward some passengers who justifiably were consideting getting off the plane after we finally boarded and then had to sit and sit on the runway. Our entertainment units did not work, and we were told that the staff would give us vouchers, then that they didn't have them and we would need to contact the airline. the airline did send us vouchers, as well as coupons for our next flight, but really, the experience was bad enough that they should have given full refunds. As to the equipment condition, the photos of the back of the seat in front of me (below) tell the story. Note that the conditions shown are not related to the quick turnaround of the plan because of the delay. They are obviously from extended and long-term neglect. Oh, and our seats didn't recline, although they were supposed to. Until this flight, I would have told anyone that Jet Blue was my favorite airline. And I fly many airlines. Now, I would need an awfully good reason to give them another try.",

     "review_text": "We arrived promptly at Logan airport in Boston Mass, hours before,for our trip to Punta Cana DR this was our first vacation for my fiance and I with our two children age 21 and 14, we had 14 other family members going with us also. Had our flights checked in on line the day before. We arrived with our AWAY luggage and had it checked in with no problems. We then all went through security with no problems, and went to sit at the area where our gate was. 30 minutes prior to the doors closing they called our names stating there was a problem with our luggage they had the batteries in the baggage in which we were not aware it could not be there. We purchased the away luggage because one of the biggest selling points were the chargeable batteries, this being our first flight we did not know they could not be installed in the bags where they belong. Later on one of the workers there told me they wish they would stop selling the AWAY bags as this has become a problem. Knowing that they should put up some type of signage stating if you have luggage equipped with batteries, they must be removed. They told us to hurry and sent us to a location where they stated our luggage would be there to pop out the batteries and make it back before they take off. They sent us to the wrong location stating our luggage would be there, that department sent us to the right location and our luggage was not there to remove the batteries. We waited so long for them to get the bags, moved so slow they could care less that this trip cost us $9,000 total including straight flight from Boston to Punta Cana and back, all inclusive resort for 7 days and a van to and from the resort. Finally they retrieved our bags we took the batteries out they had us place our 4 bags again at the baggage area and go to security, if they would have put us through the security quicker stating we had already been there we would have made the flight instead they stated we had to wait in line. I recieved a call from the flight attendant stating they were closing the doors and we would not make the flight and if I would give permission for my 14 year old child to travel with our older family members putting them in charge of her as she was a minor. I consented as they were on the plane already and thankfully I had my family members there I trust with all my heart. They made us miss our flight, separated us from our kids who were now on the flight with our family. I paid extra money for a straight flight. They took us out of the security line went to retrieve our bags again so they would no be on that plane and had us rebook two tickets one for me and my fiance the only ones they had available were to leave at 1:30 to JFK and then after 1.5 hours to Punta cana. We retrieved the tickets again checked in our bags and went through security. The flight attendants were very nice and explained everything on the plane where things were if needed. Instead of arriving at 12 noon in Punta Cana We arrived at 6PM after customs and everything we had to go through and the drive we arrived at 8:30 PM that night. My daughters were so happy to see us and I later found out the youngest one had cried she was afraid something would happen to us. There was no urgency on there part of taking care of passengers who paid so much money for a flight, no care or compassion for what occurred. Not even an apology. I will be posting this on multiple other sites as I do not want this happening to anyone else and feel this is unfair. We all work hard for our money in order to be able to take a vacation I missed a whole day of mine because they couldn't just take an extra step to help us. I'm very disappointed in Jet Blue. We will be taking many more vacations but I do not believe Jet Blue will be getting our money any more and from what I read on the other comments it looks that way for other people also. Thank you to anyone who has read this and understands my situation. I also paid extra $ to have a straight flight it is over a month later and bot one person has reached out to me and I'm owed money as I did not get my straight flight. I have contacted BBB, Jet blue and I'm still going",

The gate agents then proceeded to refuse us early boarding despite all three members in the emergency row, which we paid $180 to be sitting in being over 18 (legally they have to be over 15) because we had a minor in a different row. We were then left on the side while they boarded the plane and began to cause my son massive anxiety and he broke down in tears at the gate.

While in Orlando the next day, after losing a full day we expected to be with family, the flight to Bogota got delayed twice to 10:20pm because of bad weather. When we complained and asked for compensation for the whole ordeal, they informed us they do not compensate for weather delays and we were already compensated for the flight we lost by buying us a hotel. Imagine thinking buying a hotel to 2 stranded passangers, that the company itself stranded, to catch a flight the next day is compensation and nothing short of their responsibility as an airline to get us to our destination safely as 2 already paying customers. Furthermore the man we talked to threatened to not allow me to fly to Bogota after calling him and their company useless and saying the word \"bulls**\" once out of anger. I can not give them a bad enough rating. Avoid this airline with everything you can, they are totally useless and ineffective at everything they do, including transporting passengers as an airline. The only thing they are good for is threatening and scaring paying customers for fear of not being able to see their family who are waiting for them. I hope they go bankrupt.",

It doesn't make sense that they don't have staff appropriately scheduled.",

It was our first time using JetBlue had a situation on july 11 2019 where we arrived at the airport late but because it made it shy of 25min short of 3hrs we was not compensated. They don't compensate you like the other airlines I'm use to. Do not fly with them",
