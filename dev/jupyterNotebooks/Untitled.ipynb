I booked my flight over the phone and the rep was very helpful, in fact she checked me in over the phone too.<br/><br/>The plane was clean &amp; the flight attendants were friendly and kind, in fact they asked me several times throughout the flight if I needed anything. <br/><br/>When I booked my last minute flight, I was instructed to call them once I returned to Florida to discuss a bereavement discount that would be credited to my card. Their bereavement discount is between 10 &amp; 15 percent of the ticket price. Any discount would have been appreciated.<br/><br/>The representative I spoke with asked me if I can hold on for a few minutes. When she came back on the line, what she told me just blew me away.<br/><br/>She told me they would be crediting my card $100 even though I was only expecting $40-$45. She felt terrible that my first flight was for a sad occasion &amp; she wanted to do something nice for me. And then she apologized for leaving me on hold for five minutes.<br/><br/>This rep went above and beyond for me. Her thoughtful and generous gesture was unexpected and greatly appreciated. I couldn't believe that in this day and age, someone would be so kind-especially to a brand new customer. I will definitely fly Jet Blue in the future. I just wish they flew into Islip, but Southwest currently has the monopoly on that~for now anyway. Things can change &amp; at some point we might be seeing Jet Blue going in and out of Islip. Apparently, thousands of customers have inquired about this. Jet Blue is listening &amp; it's obvious they care about their passengers. Just look at how they handled my situation.<br/><br/>Based upon my one flight and two telephone conversations, I would use Jet Blue in a heartbeat. If and when they start going into Islip, it's bye bye Southwest.<br/><br/>Excellent prices, caring and compassionate employees and customer satisfaction is their number one priority. I would give them ten stars if I could.</p>\n",

Nice planes good on board service with much better on time performance this year then last but people the flights at your home base do not stop arriving even after 10:30. So why is there no border control at T5 after 10pm?<br/><br/>So the flight from warm country like Costa Rica arrives to a hard stop at T4 with vacationers that packed their winter gear into their checked in bags have to walk down the stairs, luckily covered.  Pile into the bus that sits and waits for everyone to disembark before leaving sitting open with cold air coming in to take them to the border control.  Ok fine we get there we pass through the border and now it is time to collect your baggage if you had to check it in. So all your bags get dumped onto the carousel and whether or not you're there they get picked off the carousel and arranged in the aisle. Ok fine. But what if your bag gets lost?<br/><br/>Well you need to talk to a JetBlue rep to report a missing bag and yada yada. According to the baggage handlers at T4 in JFK: \"Yeah...  They are notoriously hard to find!  You'll need to go to Terminal 5\"  WT... it is 11:30 pm.  Counter schedule is until 11:30 pm at T5 and i am at T4 so my baggage claim is screwed.  Lucky for me my bag came out about 40 minutes after all others have come down but what if it didn't?<br/><br/>So whilst finishing this review I decided that it is only a 2*</p>\n",

This was my first time flying JetBlue airlines and my driver took me to the wrong terminal so I missed my flight. I went to customer service at the JFK airport and had the pleasure to run into the wonderful MOHANE. She not only put me on another flight, she somehow waived the charge for me..something they don't normally do... she waived her magic wand and got me on the next flight. I have to give her the credit for me getting home in a timely manner. The customer service is wonderful for helping out with these kind of troubles. The flight itself surprised me with the leg room in economy.. I am 6'5 and it wasn't too shabby. I don't like that you have to pay for a lot of things like earbuds and stuff, but the snacks are free and it was a pretty smooth flight under the circumstances. MOHANE is the MVP</p>\n",

When I reached Detroit, I didn't receive of one of my Suitcases (it had 23.5 kg weights). At the airport, I filled the form to track the status of my bag. From that time unitl now, every day I call them to ask the status of my bag. They hardly answered and always promised me to call back, but no one called me back. My staff inside my suitcase was so important and necessary for me. Always I said them but they never paid attention. I really spent the hard situation during this time. I was a new student here, didn't know anyone, didn't have car, and I was not familiar with Detroit. I lost my staff inside the bag and couldn't buy them. The weather suddenly became cold in Detroit and I didn't have warm cloths because they were inside my lost suitcase. I called them, talked about the situation, wanted them to find my bag or compensate their mistake. They really didn't pay attention. I lost my weight and became ill because of the cold weather. I was crying sometimes and really need their help, but they were really irresponsible people. After long time, they paid me only 650 $ for delay and wanted me to fill the form related to staff inside the bag with their price and details. I spent more than 10 hours to fill the form. The staff inside the form was really important and valuable for me. I really love them and I lost them. The expenses that I estimate in my form became more that 4000 $. But, two days ago they sent me message that we only want to pay you 250$ as compensation. JetBlue is really baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad airline. Not only they are not responsible for your suitcase and always you fear that they lost your staff, but also if they lost your staff, they never compensate it. Never try JetBlue.</p>\n",

They set themselves apart by offering amenities such as in-TV at every seat, flight entertainment, and Sirius XM satellite radio. <br/><br/>JetBlue Airway fleets consist of five aircrafts. The Airbus A220-300, Airbus A320-200, Airbus A321-200, Airbus A322neo, and the Embraer 190. I love that JetBlue provides leather seats and the most legroom amongst U.S. domestic carriers. I was able to stretch my short legs out without any issues. <br/><br/>They offer free in flight entertainment, but you'll have to purchase their earphones if you're an iPhone user. You'll also have access to free gate to gate WiFi, DirecTV, Sirius XM Radio, complimentary snacks, non-alcoholic drinks, and Dunkin' Donuts coffee. You can also purchase a blanket or JetBlue snack box. I'm not sure why airlines have done away with blankets and pillows. The whole point of flying is to be comfortable. If you want more legroom you can upgrade to the EvenMore Space seat. <br/><br/>JetBlue flies to 102 destinations in North, Central, and South America. The destinations include Aruba, The Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Grenada, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Saint Maarten, Saint Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos, and the United States.<br/><br/>If you're an avid traveler you should invest in the TrueBlue frequent flyer program. The program offers members three points per dollar spent on a flight that's booked on JetBlue's online website. You can receive additional points if you use a Barclay's JetBlue Mastercard credit card.</p>\n",

Thus, another airline agreed to doing so. <br/>It's been 5 days and I still don't have my bags. WHY? because JetBlue washed their hands of the situation. I am live 2 hours from the airport (Heathrow) where my belongings are, and JetBlue closed my case without even notifying us. A baggage rep from Virgin Airlines called me to tell me my bags were there. WHAT!?  We've been on the phone back and forth (between 4 different agencies) for 4 days trying to get our stuff to our address, and still nothing. <br/>I'm hoping upper management sees this post and does something about it! Please already, I want my belongings.  This has taken so much time and energy and I am not properly clothed for England weather.</p>\n",

As an avid traveler, I typically avoid Jet Blue because they are constantly delayed, but for this trip I took a chance, and wish I had not. <br/><br/>We were supposed to depart at 1:59, and we received no less than 6 emails indicating a changing departure time. The only explanation given was that the pilots were nearing their expiration time, so they left, but the incoming pilots are delayed, so now they are waiting for the initial pilots to come back. My question is, why was this not communicated earlier? JFK is not a large airport- where could these pilots be! My opinion is they did not want to take the flight so they are delaying themselves getting back so their expiration time will coincide . <br/><br/>So you may be asking yourself, what have they done to compensate for this OVER TWO HOUR DELAY? Oh. The solution- give us free mini bottles of water... yes, that's definitely going to resolve the issue. I will 100% never be flying Jet Blue again. Other airlines are far more reliable, have better service, and have not caused the delays this incompetent airline has.</p>\n",

Your airline extorted a $585.00 change fee from me for the exact same reservation, also two weeks later.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I'm left feeling ripped-off .... and \"extorted\" is not too strong a term under the circumstances. <br/><br/>Spare me the travel voucher.

I booked my flight over the phone and the rep was very helpful, in fact she checked me in over the phone too.The plane was clean & the flight attendants were friendly and kind, in fact they asked me several times throughout the flight if I needed anything. When I booked my last minute flight, I was instructed to call them once I returned to Florida to discuss a bereavement discount that would be credited to my card. Their bereavement discount is between 10 & 15 percent of the ticket price. Any discount would have been appreciated.The representative I spoke with asked me if I can hold on for a few minutes. When she came back on the line, what she told me just blew me away.She told me they would be crediting my card $100 even though I was only expecting $40-$45. She felt terrible that my first flight was for a sad occasion & she wanted to do something nice for me. And then she apologized for leaving me on hold for five minutes.This rep went above and beyond for me. Her thoughtful and generous gesture was unexpected and greatly appreciated. I couldn't believe that in this day and age, someone would be so kind-especially to a brand new customer. I will definitely fly Jet Blue in the future. I just wish they flew into Islip, but Southwest currently has the monopoly on that~for now anyway. Things can change & at some point we might be seeing Jet Blue going in and out of Islip. Apparently, thousands of customers have inquired about this. Jet Blue is listening & it's obvious they care about their passengers. Just look at how they handled my situation.Based upon my one flight and two telephone conversations, I would use Jet Blue in a heartbeat. If and when they start going into Islip, it's bye bye Southwest.Excellent prices, caring and compassionate employees and customer satisfaction is their number one priority. I would give them ten stars if I could.\"}],\n",

From that time unitl now, every day I call them to ask the status of my bag. They hardly answered and always promised me to call back, but no one called me back. My staff inside my suitcase was so important and necessary for me. Always I said them but they never paid attention. I really spent the hard situation during this time. I was a new student here, didn't know anyone, didn't have car, and I was not familiar with Detroit. I lost my staff inside the bag and couldn't buy them. The weather suddenly became cold in Detroit and I didn't have warm cloths because they were inside my lost suitcase. I called them, talked about the situation, wanted them to find my bag or compensate their mistake. They really didn't pay attention. I lost my weight and became ill because of the cold weather. I was crying sometimes and really need their help, but they were really irresponsible people. After long time, they paid me only 650 $ for delay and wanted me to fill the form related to staff inside the bag with their price and details. I spent more than 10 hours to fill the form. The staff inside the form was really important and valuable for me. I really love them and I lost them. The expenses that I estimate in my form became more that 4000 $. But, two days ago they sent me message that we only want to pay you 250$ as compensation. JetBlue is really baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad airline. Not only they are not responsible for your suitcase and always you fear that they lost your staff, but also if they lost your staff, they never compensate it. Never try JetBlue.\"}],\n",

They set themselves apart by offering amenities such as in-TV at every seat, flight entertainment, and Sirius XM satellite radio. JetBlue Airway fleets consist of five aircrafts. The Airbus A220-300, Airbus A320-200, Airbus A321-200, Airbus A322neo, and the Embraer 190. I love that JetBlue provides leather seats and the most legroom amongst U.S. domestic carriers. I was able to stretch my short legs out without any issues. They offer free in flight entertainment, but you'll have to purchase their earphones if you're an iPhone user. You'll also have access to free gate to gate WiFi, DirecTV, Sirius XM Radio, complimentary snacks, non-alcoholic drinks, and Dunkin' Donuts coffee. You can also purchase a blanket or JetBlue snack box. I'm not sure why airlines have done away with blankets and pillows. The whole point of flying is to be comfortable. If you want more legroom you can upgrade to the EvenMore Space seat. JetBlue flies to 102 destinations in North, Central, and South America. The destinations include Aruba, The Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Grenada, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Saint Maarten, Saint Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos, and the United States.If you're an avid traveler you should invest in the TrueBlue frequent flyer program. The program offers members three points per dollar spent on a flight that's booked on JetBlue's online website. You can receive additional points if you use a Barclay's JetBlue Mastercard credit card.\"}],\n",

As an avid traveler, I typically avoid Jet Blue because they are constantly delayed, but for this trip I took a chance, and wish I had not. We were supposed to depart at 1:59, and we received no less than 6 emails indicating a changing departure time. The only explanation given was that the pilots were nearing their expiration time, so they left, but the incoming pilots are delayed, so now they are waiting for the initial pilots to come back. My question is, why was this not communicated earlier? JFK is not a large airport- where could these pilots be! My opinion is they did not want to take the flight so they are delaying themselves getting back so their expiration time will coincide . So you may be asking yourself, what have they done to compensate for this OVER TWO HOUR DELAY? Oh. The solution- give us free mini bottles of water... yes, that's definitely going to resolve the issue. I will 100% never be flying Jet Blue again.

Unfortunately, I needed a last minute flight into NY a few weeks ago. Jet Blue made it happen. I booked my flight over the phone and the rep was very helpful, in fact she checked me in over the phone too.The plane was clean & the flight attendants were friendly and kind, in fact they asked me several times throughout the flight if I needed anything. When I booked my last minute flight, I was instructed to call them once I returned to Florida to discuss a bereavement discount that would be credited to my card. Their bereavement discount is between 10 & 15 percent of the ticket price. Any discount would have been appreciated.The representative I spoke with asked me if I can hold on for a few minutes. When she came back on the line, what she told me just blew me away.She told me they would be crediting my card $100 even though I was only expecting $40-$45. She felt terrible that my first flight was for a sad occasion & she wanted to do something nice for me. And then she apologized for leaving me on hold for five minutes.This rep went above and beyond for me. Her thoughtful and generous gesture was unexpected and greatly appreciated. I couldn't believe that in this day and age, someone would be so kind-especially to a brand new customer. I will definitely fly Jet Blue in the future. I just wish they flew into Islip, but Southwest currently has the monopoly on that~for now anyway. Things can change & at some point we might be seeing Jet Blue going in and out of Islip. Apparently, thousands of customers have inquired about this. Jet Blue is listening & it's obvious they care about their passengers. Just look at how they handled my situation.Based upon my one flight and two telephone conversations, I would use Jet Blue in a heartbeat. If and when they start going into Islip, it's bye bye Southwest.Excellent prices, caring and compassionate employees and customer satisfaction is their number one priority.

I had the flight with JetBlue on 16 August. When I reached Detroit, I didn't receive of one of my Suitcases (it had 23.5 kg weights). At the airport, I filled the form to track the status of my bag. From that time unitl now, every day I call them to ask the status of my bag. They hardly answered and always promised me to call back, but no one called me back. My staff inside my suitcase was so important and necessary for me. Always I said them but they never paid attention. I really spent the hard situation during this time. I was a new student here, didn't know anyone, didn't have car, and I was not familiar with Detroit. I lost my staff inside the bag and couldn't buy them. The weather suddenly became cold in Detroit and I didn't have warm cloths because they were inside my lost suitcase. I called them, talked about the situation, wanted them to find my bag or compensate their mistake. They really didn't pay attention. I lost my weight and became ill because of the cold weather. I was crying sometimes and really need their help, but they were really irresponsible people. After long time, they paid me only 650 $ for delay and wanted me to fill the form related to staff inside the bag with their price and details. I spent more than 10 hours to fill the form. The staff inside the form was really important and valuable for me. I really love them and I lost them. The expenses that I estimate in my form became more that 4000 $. But, two days ago they sent me message that we only want to pay you 250$ as compensation. JetBlue is really baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad airline.

They wanted to apply the same principle as Southwest by offering low cost travel. They set themselves apart by offering amenities such as in-TV at every seat, flight entertainment, and Sirius XM satellite radio. JetBlue Airway fleets consist of five aircrafts. The Airbus A220-300, Airbus A320-200, Airbus A321-200, Airbus A322neo, and the Embraer 190. I love that JetBlue provides leather seats and the most legroom amongst U.S. domestic carriers. I was able to stretch my short legs out without any issues. They offer free in flight entertainment, but you'll have to purchase their earphones if you're an iPhone user. You'll also have access to free gate to gate WiFi, DirecTV, Sirius XM Radio, complimentary snacks, non-alcoholic drinks, and Dunkin' Donuts coffee. You can also purchase a blanket or JetBlue snack box. I'm not sure why airlines have done away with blankets and pillows. The whole point of flying is to be comfortable. If you want more legroom you can upgrade to the EvenMore Space seat. JetBlue flies to 102 destinations in North, Central, and South America. The destinations include Aruba, The Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Grenada, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Saint Maarten, Saint Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos, and the United States.If you're an avid traveler you should invest in the TrueBlue frequent flyer program. The program offers members three points per dollar spent on a flight that's booked on JetBlue's online website. You can receive additional points if you use a Barclay's JetBlue Mastercard credit card.\"}], [{'date': '7/10/2019', 'rating': '1.0 star rating', 'review': \"Lost bags still MIA!

We were supposed to depart at 1:59, and we received no less than 6 emails indicating a changing departure time. The only explanation given was that the pilots were nearing their expiration time, so they left, but the incoming pilots are delayed, so now they are waiting for the initial pilots to come back. My question is, why was this not communicated earlier? JFK is not a large airport- where could these pilots be! My opinion is they did not want to take the flight so they are delaying themselves getting back so their expiration time will coincide . So you may be asking yourself, what have they done to compensate for this OVER TWO HOUR DELAY? Oh.
