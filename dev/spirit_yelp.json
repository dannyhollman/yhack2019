Let me start by saying me and my family of four, we're on our way to Atlanta for my oldest son's wedding. This was after having a wedding in Los Angeles for my second daughter. The weddings were one week apart which was difficult enough. So we decided to fly Spirit Airlines and save a little money and even put our clothes in one big suitcase and one suit bag as our checked luggage.The flight was OK, and we were already prepared for the very tight seats and no service without paying extra. So we kept everything to a minimum and got to Atlanta and our giant suit bag was lost. This was a big black suit bag with a pink ribbon on top. We waited, we checked, and started contacting all the proper authorities to let them know the bag was lost. Remember this is a wedding weekend, so we have all of our son the best with us and I'm traveling with my sons and my wife. So we f course we have new shoes, new clothes and all kinds of personal items in the big suitcase. My wife even has special makeup and toiletries for sensitive people. After trying to speak with people in LA, Atlanta and anywhere else the plane might've been going,... after five days still lost! \u00a0I finally put in a formal complaint for reimbursement.After a huge run around, And being passed from agent to agent, customer service person to customer service person, I finally thought I was with the final person .This is after Jose, Darlene, Freddy,....My current person is Sean M. Sean sends an email saying he has my case now and they will take an addition 3 weeks to try and locate the luggage. WHAT!?!So we've lost over $3000 worth of personal stuff including flat irons, electronics, irreplaceable clothes and knickknacks. And now they have another 30 days!!! Mind you, if this was a regular business trip or little getaway, \u00a0I would he fine. But they ruined our special occasion and we've be repurchasing most of our crap every since the weekend of the wedding!I will never fly them again, neither will my now \"10 piece family\" and I'm gonna post and let everyone know its not worth the poor service, limited accommodations and horrible service.

This airline is a \"bait and switch\" cheap crap airline. Your flights might leave and arrive on time, but that's it. Your seats are crap (none recline and are hard metal with little-to-no padding). Terrible for flights longer than 20 minutes. There's no room on either side of you--you are packed like sardines in a can, and I believe Spirit Airlines would charge an extra fee for the air passengers breathe if they could. This airline charges for EVERYTHING and almost twice what other airlines charge for added fees. Charging for their crappy seats is the biggest crime next to CEO Edward M. Christie III, making almost 6 million a year. \u00a0I will NEVER fly with this airline again. Both Alaska Airlines and Southwest would have been more than 100 dollars cheaper each way for my trip by the time you add up everything this airline charges.They bait people unfamiliar with them with a low flight cost that in the end cost passengers more to fly to their destinations with all of the additional fees.

But is flying with the budget carrier worth it?\u00a0I've flown Spirit before, it wasn't the greatest but I decided to give it one last try. I purchased what I thought was an ultimate \"steal\" bragging to the others who invited me. I got 2 tickets round trip for $170 each nonstop from LAX, I booked immediately! Upon check-in I paid $45 for a carry on, $15 per seat to ensure that my husband who has anxiety flying on planes was seated next to me, $50 for a check in on the flight back and another $15 each for seats next to each other again. So was it worth flying with Spirit? Yes, and more so NO. The cons outweigh the pros. One pro, cheap at first when you initially book. Cons: no tv, no complimentary drink or snacks, and the most irritating - fees for a carry on and seat assignment.You think you've struck gold with this cheap company but in reality, you'd pay the same flight with the few other reputable airlines that do not charge for seats, baggage, drinks, snacks, a tv to watch movies or play games etc. Spirit, you've lost my business in the future.

Now, I will delve into the juicy part. Our flight departed LAX to DFW at 9:40am. We did not start to board until 9:30am. After we took our seats and waited for the other passengers to board, we sat around for about 20 minutes when the crew announced that they were still trying to find a pilot and had us all GET OFF the PLANE and WAIT for them to FIND a PILOT. They told us our pilot was a no-call, no-show. So they knowingly boarded us without a pilot and we had to wait about an hour and a half to re-assemble and board the plane. We did not take off until about 11:30am. Now on our way home, DFW to LAX, the flight was scheduled to depart 7am and flight time was 2 hrs and 45 minutes. Again, we arrived on time and we ACTUALLY boarded ON TIME. We were relieved and the plane took off. After about an hour and a half, the pilot tells us there MAY be a problem with the air conditioning and must turn the plane around for maintenance and land back at DFW while the fire department inspects the plane. (Apparently Spirit can't even check their planes beforehand). We fly back, the hour and 30 minutes, land on the runway and are stuck on the plane for half an hour. Fire department enters and literally looks at the plane for 1 minute and gives us the all clear. The crew then proceeds to de-plane us because we need a new plane. As we are sitting in the lobby, the receptionist tells us (in these exact words), \" We are....... uh... uh sorry... for the uh... inconvenience, you will be recieving at voucher for $25..... $50...... uhhhh no, $100. \" Well that was lie.

Another thing to consider are the cheap quality seats. If you are traveling more than an hour or have back issues then you are going to be hating the hours sitting on their seats.

The astounding thing is none of these \"reviews\" admit that all the negatives are CLEARLY STATED by Spirit. Yes, they try to upsell you when you book. If you really want to save money, simply pass on all \"extras\" and be prepared: plan workarounds so you don't need luggage, carry-on (YOU'RE STILL ALLOWED A PERSONAL ITEM! SEE BELOW), snacks or drinks. Easy-peasy. YOU KNOW DAMNED WELL you will pay for luggage and/or carry-on, and more yet if you don't pay in advance. SOLUTION: don't come with luggage or a carry-on, OR compare with other airlines' costs before booking, and simply include ALL costs when comparing apples with apples (for which you must make adjustments).YOU KNOW DAMNED WELL you will pay for snacks, drinks and YES, EVEN WATER on board. SOLUTION: BRING AN EMPTY WATER BOTTLE AND FILL IT UP ONCE PAST THE TSA LINES. Bring snacks and pack it in your \"personal\" item, which doesn't cost an extra dime. Duh. If you end up having to buy onboard, so be it--their prices are not bad (and I sometimes buy a snack--the \"triple play\" with a delicious cheese tray, an alkie-sized (2 oz) bottle of Tangeray or several other liquor choices and a soda or mixer, is a great value at $13, no tax, no tip).Bring the maximum sized \"personal item,\" which is what I do. Mine packs a laptop computer, bulky cord, bulky ergonomic Logitech mouse, two full days'-worth of pills in a four-part rather bulky pill container, emergency underwear, and a ton of reading material. I not only stuff it to the gills, but I always wear pants (short or long) with plenty of pockets, which I also stuff.I often thank God (with whom I have only a fleeting relationship) for the fact I was born (and not aborted) in what was for decades the freest country ever on the planet. This is one of the benefits of what remains of entrepreneurial capitalism: choice, with competition. It has made flying back and forth to our 2nd home in Southern WI (where my wife spends the summer with our two Goldens) affordable: as low as $180 round-trip LAX-ORD (Chicago's O'Hare)-LAX. Spirit really helped out here, for which I thank the genius behind Spirit Airlines.That all said (and sorry for the ultra-long post--the other posters inspired me!), I just got to Chicago after our 9:30am flight was delayed until 5:30pm. First, engine malfunction and then they couldn't get the cabin cool enough. At around 1pm we boarded a new plane and, nearly ready for takeoff, they herded us off the plane because boarding took five minutes longer than anticipated and they had strayed two minutes past the time allowed under FAA rules for two of the cabin crew (they already had a long day). They found two new crew members and we took off at 5:30pm. First part: stuff happens (consider your car breaking down on a long trip; same idea; it happens). Second part: government happens. Stupid government rules. I might care about pilots, but cabin crew? Two minutes? Really?So, they are not perfect--no company or person is. But overall, the value is incomparable. And I'm learning to use Spirit miles (I have a Spirit credit card) to my advantage. One one-way flight cost 5,000 miles plus $21 ORD-LAX (the \"usual\" cost is 27,500 miles).

I got out of the boarding line and walked back over to see what the agent wanted. The agent stated \"you have to pay for your carry on.\" I stated to him \" I paid in Philadelphia.\" He said \"Oh you did.\" He proceeds to check and states \" No you only paid for your bag to Los Angeles.\" I explained to him that we had a 4-5 hour layover from Philadelphia to Las Vegas. He did not care and said \" You have to pay\" so I did. I knew he was wrong and why he was using his little power that he had @ this time to charge me more money. I humbly got on my flight and waited to land in Las Vegas to speak to another agent that I was hoping was not as animated as the agent in Los Angeles and had integrity. So in the end I asked the agent in Las Vegas and as I knew....... due to it not being a 12 hr gap in between I was not supposed to be charged another 65 dollars. I was refunded the 65 dollars by the way! The sad thing of this whole situation is that you had three employees that did not have the company best interest. The 3 male agents made me feel as if I was being discriminated against because I was a woman and asked a question. Now the reason why I say discriminated against is due to my husband having a carry on and they did not ask him to pay another fee. So anyways please ask questions if you have concerns. Oh and the question was \" is the seat in the back?\" The reason why I asked that question is because my husband wanted to volunteer and sit in different seats for leg room. When I asked that question the agent stated \"do you want to sit there or not?\" Why would it be so personal to him that I asked this question smh......

Bring only a personal bag (backpack recommended)2. Bring a reusable water bottle to fill up at the airport3. Check-in BEFORE arriving at the airport to avoid extra costs4. Check-in exactly twenty-four hours before departure5. Make sure to do their own research on Spirit's rulesHonestly, Spirit Airlines is not as bad as people make it seem. \u00a0There are many airlines across the world that follow the same structure as Spirit's, but many people are not used to it yet because there are not a lot of airlines in the United States that are considered to be low cost airlines. \u00a0Spirit really is a great choice as long as you know what you are getting yourself into."}, {"count": 130, "date": "8/11/2019", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "If I could make this review zero stars I would.

After charging more than it said online for our baggage, then pushing back the take off time by hours, they made no attempt to announce that our zone was boarding. Once we ran to the line and told them that we were zone 4, they laughed at us and told us that we missed our flight. We're seasoned travelers, no chance. The person announcing which zones could board couldn't put together a sentence and kept announcing that people cannot get in line until their zone was called. He even announced for people to not wait in line and to sit back down. We waited, they never announce our zone. We didn't hear it?

I didn't need a drink, snack or anything else on the plane, I just needed a fast, more affordable option. Here's my story:On a Wednesday evening on my commute home, my father called to let me know that my grandfather, who had been readmitted to a hospital, was going to be taken off life support the next day. The next morning, on my commute to work I was informed that he passed quickly. As I was preparing a statement to request time off to attend the funeral I found that the funeral would be that Saturday, meaning I had to leave the next day. Of course, that sent me scrambling to find a reasonable fare to OKC, which isn't always kind to the wallet. My experience working in travel swooped in to the rescue, and I found a decent one-way fare to Dallas (separate one-way back to LA) and my dad would pick me up and take me to Oklahoma for the viewing.As mentioned above, I didn't need much, just to get to Oklahoma City as fast as possible without spending over $900 (yes, that was my alternative). When I checked the bag, the guy was pretty rude, but I brushed it off. After I got through security and was ready to go, they boarded everyone and prepared to leave, then made us all get all our things and get off the plane due to a \"maintenance issue.\" Okay, now I was worried about missing the viewing, because I still had close to 4 hours in driving to go. When I told the woman I was on my way to my grandfather's funeral and asked if she could reaccommodate me on another airline, she was a real bitch about it.I had to run up and down the concourse, checking the flight board for every flight reasonably close to OKC to get a potential last minute ticket on another airline because Spirit refused to help. I checked with American to get to OKC or Dallas (nothing in time) and Allegiant to Tulsa (also too late). I had to suck it up and stay on Spirit. To add insult to injury, they stuck me in the daycare section and parents who forgot headphones thought it was acceptable to blast videos (and flight attendants apparently felt it was unacceptable) to ask them to stop for disturbing other passengers.When I got to Dallas, luckily my dad was able to get to the funeral home in time before the viewing ended. I would have been furious otherwise, because the service was a bit different in that we began at the cemetery and I never would have had a last look.You can check out a review I made of Frontier Airlines a few years ago, and even though they were an affordable option, I chose more expensive competitors rather than fly with them again.

So, I posted on my personal blog about my adventure with Spirit Airlines. It's really bad. It's really one of the worst airlines I've ever flown.This airline claims to be the \"Bare Fare\" because of their \"cheap flights\". The only thing that's bare is, well, it's the entire experience, so here it is.....Unfortunately my travel agent \u00a0booked our flights last minute, even though the trip was planned June 2017. We purchased our March 31st flight in February. From now on I'm making the travel arrangements. Our departure time wasn't that bad. LAX at 8:30 in the morning, with an estimated Chicago arrival time at 2:50. This wasn't bad considering our check-in for our place was after 4.The price of the nonstop flight wasn't that cheap. I had found cheaper in September, when I was booking my \"flying solo\" Thanksgiving trip to Massachusetts.The check-in wasn't easy. You can't go up to the counter to check-in if you choose. You must check-in at the automated station, weigh your own bags and tag your own cases. There was a long line, but we got to the airport in time, so that wasn't a problem. This was the problem, the fact that bag check is $50 PER CHECKED BAG!!!!! That's right, we spent $100 before we even got to Chicago because we had TWO checked bags. BEWARE, they charge you $50 a bag AND it MUST be under 40 LBS. Anything over is an additional fee. Most airlines only charge a $100 added fee if your bag is over 50 LBS. I couldn't believe it!!! Buyer BEWARE, they will also charge $25 if you have a carry-on with wheels, which I did, but I carried it with the straps, so they didn't charge me.The seats were just awful! They were super cramped, both in leg room and hip space. The guy next to me, who just happened to be an employee was really tall. I can't image what he was going through.You know how most airlines offer complimentary beverage services? Well, you don't get that with the \"Bare Fare\" airline. Every beverage, including water, has a price. SERIOUSLY? The airline sucks. I travel a lot and never in all of my 21 years on earth have I experienced something so bare. At least on Southwest you get pretzels!I really don't care if you have the youngest crew in the air. The service I experienced was poor. Once we arrived in Chicago we had to wait a \u00a0long while for our luggage. I was talking to some unfortunate fool from my flight, who said she only 'flys' Spirit in a jam and each time the service gets worse and worse. She said, \"Well, at least we're home.\" To which I replied, \"Oh no honey, I'm from California, just beginning my trip.\"The only thing I got out of this HORRIBLE airline is a dirty bag (which was brand spanking new BTW) and less money to spend on the things that I happen to enjoy (visiting new places).This new travel culture is pretty sad. You constantly hear of people being mistreated on their flights, poor quality service and expensive ticket prices. There really does have to be a change. I'm not at all expecting to fly for free, and travelers shouldn't act like jerks, but the service you get for the price you pay is truly depressing.If you can, stay away from this airline at all costs. \u00a0Find a better airline if you can!!!!

We called Spirit, they alerted us that they had cancelled our flight and would not give us a reason. We asked what alternate flight they would place us on, and they said they would not place us on an alternate flight, and that they would not transfer us to another airline. We asked if we could therefore have a refund for the cancelled flight, which they also denied. They literally stole our money. Another instance, more recently my wife and I booked a flight with flight insurance, and received an itinerary for the wrong flight. I immediately called to alert them that they had sent me the wrong flight itinerary, different than the flight I had reserved, and they said they could not switch my flight to the one I had actually ordered. I therefore asked for a refund, and told them I had purchased flight insurance, and they refused to refund me, only to give me a future flight credit, which I will never use, minus $150 in charges that should not apply due to the fact that I was well within the 24 hour period of cancellation. All of this took around 4 hours of talking and waiting on the phone, several clueless people and supervisors, and even addressing them calmly I could not make them budge. I have still not received my money back from this escapade either. Please save yourself the hassle, anger, and financial ruin of flying Spirit. Not only will they cancel last minute, not follow their own contract, and not refund you your money, but their planes are horrible uncomfortable.

First time it was 60 dollars cheaper than the other airline with 2 free bags. \u00a0So I jumped all over it especially since I had to buy 2 tickets and I was not taking a bag for this quick one day trip to Las Vegas. \u00a0So my friend and I fly to Vegas for her birthday. \u00a0From Los Angeles to Las Vegas it is about 47 \u00a0minutes. \u00a0When I get to the gate, I have a purse. \u00a0It's a large purse but certainly not a tote or duffel. \u00a0So they charged me for it. \u00a0 Yup sure did. $40 each way. \u00a0So wow, I should have spent the $60 more and not have a hassle. \u00a0The flight was ok. \u00a0They do not give anything while you're on the flight you have to pay to breathe. \u00a0 If there was a true emergency and the oxygen masks did come down, I'm almost sure they would charge you ambulance rates to use them. \u00a0So after having to pay $40 for my purse (yes I know what a duffel bag is and no it really was a purse), I had to sit in the most uncomfortable seats for 52 minutes. \u00a0I am 5'3 and \u00a01/4 (yes the quarter matters to me) and there was absolutely no leg room for me. \u00a0 I was so over spirit at that point and vowed to never fly them again. \u00a0 Fast forward to 2017, a friend pays for me to fly up the Oakland. She sends me the flight information and it is with spirit airlines. \u00a0Oh nooooo! \u00a0my first thought. \u00a0This means I have to endure 54 minutes of spirit airlines! \u00a0So I graciously get to the airport, and I'm actually early. \u00a0hmmmm at 15 minutes prior to boarding the plane is not there. 25 minutes after original departure time, here comes the plane pulling up.So in sunny Los Angeles, California it's a warm 85 degrees. In Oakland the forecast is a high of 69. \u00a0So this sunny L.A. gal needs a jacket. \u00a0I have a puffy jacket that folds up into pouch with \u00a0a strap. \u00a0Now I get to the gate with my carry on, mind you I have a purse that is smaller than the last spirit experience but I shoved it in my one bag. \u00a0When I get to the gate with my bag and my jacket balled up in it's carry bag, yes the gate agent asked me about it and told me it was over my luggage allowance of one personal item. \u00a0It would not ball up in my approved carry on, so I took it out of the carry bag and put on my jacket and was able to board without paying for my jacket. \u00a0My seat is the one to the rear. \u00a0Yes the very last row. \u00a0I sit down and try not to lay on the person next to me. \u00a0I think hard...hmmm did this happen the last time? \u00a0I can barely fit in this seat (no I am not overweight). \u00a0So as I'm unwillingly leaning on a strangers shoulder as he is mine, we take off. The flight attendants are chatting about the worst takeoffs they have seen and the times they saw planes almost crash. \u00a0Really!? \u00a0this is not the thing you should be talking about. \u00a0It didn't bother me but I'm sure there are uneasy passengers on this flight. \u00a0I grab the menu to see what I can enjoy on this short flight. \u00a0I share the menu with the person sitting next to me because he may as well be \u00a0sitting with me since we have absolutely no room to move our already touching arms. \u00a0So on the menu, there are buzz balls, and cup o noodles. \u00a0I don't look any further. \u00a0Buzz balls! what the what is this? \u00a0some low budget 20% alcohol drink. \u00a0Welp at 20% I suppose you will be buzzed. \u00a0But the cup o noodles, really? \u00a0I wonder if they charge for the hot water. \u00a0And what happens with hot water and turbulence? On my return flight the the flight attendant says I'm going to shut the doors and if you have a problem with it catch me outside how about that. \u00a0At this point I'm thinking I'm on the ghetto flight and Danielle Bregoli will be in the \"big seats\". \u00a0*sigh* so over it. \u00a0 After, take off they played a trivia game. \u00a0One winner got a pack of M&M's an the lady in front of me won a few one way tickets to fly with spirit. \u00a0She asked the man who won the M&M's if they could trade gifts."}, {"count": 259, "date": "2/7/2019", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Worst airline!!!

The price is generally lower with Spirit as compared to other airlines, when everything is factored in, but you MUST UNDERSTAND the pricing elements or you're going to be disappointed and possibly irritated as I was.In general, the actual flight itself was fine, e.g., check-in, boarding and service while flying. \u00a0Plus the seating accommodations and amenities are generally very clean. \u00a0Every airline sometimes has delay & cancellation issues, so because my flights with Spirit went smooth in those aspects I can't speak to those other reviewers' issues with Spirit. \u00a0The negative part of the flight \"experience\" were the add-on fees after booking and the no-frills elements of the flights as compared to most other airlines. \u00a0So knowing how that works now makes me more knowledgeable when comparing airlines for future travel. \u00a0 As for the add-on fees, yes it's irritating to get hit with baggage fees, seat fees, check-in fees, and security upgrade fees after the fact. \u00a0Re baggage fees, most airlines now charge baggage fees, so that's getting to be normal. \u00a0Seat fees are something that's sort of difficult to absorb cause I'm paying for an airline ticket, and then I have to additionally pay for a seat? \u00a0I get it that seats closer to the front are more desirable to most (not me), but to pay for a seat regardless of where you sit, that seems ridiculous. \u00a0But I get it now and will factor that into the process in the future when shopping airlines for a flight destination. The check-in fees do NOT apply if you check-in online, and in fact there are boarding advantages of checking in online, so that's a great motivator. \u00a0Finally the security upgrade wasn't really desirable to me cause I allowed for enough time, but I could see how that could make sense in the future if in a time crunch.As for the no-frills aspects, the seats are slightly different in that they don't recline, there is no pocket in front with/for reading materials, the tray table is very minimal, and there is no media entertainment (no video or audio). \u00a0All of these things do NOT bother me, as I never recline in seats anyway, and I bring my own reading and video/audio entertainment. Also, all service items come for a price, even a water or non-alcoholic drink. \u00a0Again, this does not bother me as I usually bring my own water (fill up my thermos after security) and my own snacks. I believe Spirit is onto something with their no-frills format. \u00a0These days flight is basic transportation, so perhaps many of the service elements we've been exposed to in the past when flight was more of a luxury/novelty experience are not necessary as part of the basic package any longer.In conclusion, I would recommend Spirit Airlines to friends, but with a disclosure of all the elements (above) ahead of time."}, {"count": 283, "date": "7/14/2019", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "By far the worst airline.

We paid extra to sit on their \"big comfortable\" chairs on our flight back home since the regular seats were so bad. Those don't recline either and they sit straight up as well. They are just have a little more padding. No TVs and the flight and the flight attendants are very unprofessional. Checking in your bags you pay to check in is a huge hassle and the lines are stupid long.

Booked a flight for me & my bf, one way, (the other flight I booked through United). I only booked this leg because it was the only non-stop to LAX. It was my first (and last) Spirit Airlines flight.After booking online , I received a confirmation email saying, \u00a0\"If we have trouble processing your payment, we'll update you again via email. No further action is necessary at this time.\" Showed up to airport day of flight, and was told that we had no reservation.Thank god I showed up over an hr in advance. The agent was baffled and called another agent over. Both were unable to tell me why. Ended up having to pay 140 more for new flights, but with downgraded seats, and had to still pay for my baggage. Got on the plane and the plane was only HALF full. Upon leaving the counter, the agent gave me a receipt and told me to call Spirit Customer Service to get a refund for the difference when I arrive home.The flight itself was a horror. Tiny, cramped, the seats wouldn't recline on a 5 hr flight, and the attendant spent 25 minutes loudly over the loudspeaker trying to aggressively & obnoxiously \u00a0sell a Spirit Airline CC. When I asked to purchase some Pringles, the other flight attendant gave such an attitude, as if I was annoying her. { There was also a screaming child behind me and the man in front of me (in the extra leg room seat I originally had booked and paid for), was really smelly. I digress - those humans had nothing to do with the flight, but it really sort of put things over the top.} The flight was also very cold - even though we both were wearing sweaters, with the air off, and naturally, there were no amenities even to purchase, like earphones - which I'd have gladly purchased to let me sleep with the screaming child... \u00a0I could'nt get off this flight fast enough.I called today to follow up on the refund of difference, and no one has been able to help me since 9am.

I deeply feel that this is a regular, shady, bait & switch tactic that Spirit runs on a regular basis. When I posted about this whole debacle on Twitter, I received a mssg from someone else this also happened to. I really think that they just assume the customer is never going to follow up on it. I never yell and am always kind and respectful, but the last CS phone rep had me yelling b/c they just feed you complete lies and shift the blame saying it's another dept's responsibility. I simply asked why no one emailed or called me to tell me the res was cancelled, like their email instructs, and he couldn't even answer that and simply said \" I understand your frustration\". I\"m now waiting for another dept to return my call. I don't think this airline will last long, because they are absolutely terrible, could care less about Customer Service, and have the gall to email you confirmations and then cancel the reservation, and pull a classic bait & switch.

I've flown on other budget airlines such as \u00a0Air Asia and Jetstar before and had a bad experience where my flights would always be delayed. So in comparison, my experience with Spirit was far better. I used Spirit for my flight from LAX to Chicago. To be honest, I came in without any high expectations as I've never heard of Spirit Airlines before and thought that my flight would be delayed (as it is typical for budget airlines to be always running late). But after being able check-in online without having to interact with any agent and arriving to Chicago earlier than expected, I was pretty pleased. Also, I took a quick peek at the Departure/Arrival boards before I left, and pretty much all but maybe 1 or 2 of their flights were on time!The flight itself was alright- don't expect much as this is suppose to be a budget-friendly flight. It's not like other airlines where you get complimentary beverages + the seats are definitely much thinner. You can't recline the seats back so if you're the type who needs some comfort while traveling, I highly suggest bringing a travel pillow \u00a0(for me, I personally didn't mind as it was only a less than 4 hour flight). Leg room was alright for me as well. I'm 5'7 and still had some room (typically, my legs are super squished when I fly budget airlines) when I was sitting down but was a tad squished when I tried crossing my legs. They sell snacks on the flight too and there was always someone walking up and down the aisle, picking up trash. At the end of the flight, they thanked all of us for flying and acknowledged that they know they don't offer the best amenities as their company's business outline is to just try to make flights cheap. They also ran a contest/raffle just for people who were sitting in the middle seats for a free gift certificate. They also tried to get people to sign up for their credit card membership program but they weren't too aggressive about it.A huge con about this airline though are the extra fees but if you're conscious about it, then this wouldn't be too much of a problem. When I booked my flight, I didn't realize that there was a $49 extra fee just for carry-on. Not wanting to have to pay that, it forced me to pack that everything for 4 nights in my Herschel back pack (e.g. laptop, outfits, makeup etc etc...I take huge pride in that now LOL). They also charge for things like seat selection, TSA pre-check and more. It can get tempting to feel the need to have to pay extra but it can definitely be avoided.

San Diego to Chicago. Our departure was supposed to be 1:00 PM we asked several staff for spirit and they told us it would be delayed until 4:00 pm. we come to find out they they took a plane that was intended for Las Vegas and took everyone at 4:30 pm. After they told multiple people it would be hours delayed so they can leave and do whatever they please with their time. they unfortunately made \"multiple announcements\" but they told everyone it was okay to leave so they came back confused. my family and I stayed in the airport in the food court where the announcements aren't heard. However we asked multiple staff members for that airline in the front and they told us it was still delayed until 4:00 Pm. my father was annoyed so we're all of everyone else they lied to. And he requested a different flight which they were bringing a connection flight to Las Vegas connecting to Chicago. They made it very clear they did not care what we decided to go with \"if you don't want to go on that flight I don't know what to tell you\" \"it's not our fault you did not hear the 'multiple announcements'\". They called over police to watch my dad \"in the polo shirt..'very aggressive'\". So we're currently boarding the flight to Las Vegas then Chicago and instead of originally landing at 8:00 Pm with the already delayed flight. we are supposedly landing at 4:00 am and don't know if we're getting a refund. in conclusion me and my family will NEVER fly Spirit ever again. thank you."}, {"count": 406, "date": "5/3/2019", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "If there was a lower number than 1 star, I would pick that. \u00a0I feel scammed and duped by this airline. \u00a0Pay $47 for your cary on bag? \u00a0Pay another $15-60 to select a seat?

I booked this fight as a part of a cheap Vegas package. If I didn't go with Spirit, the trip would likely not have happened. I booked with Spirit, and the trip almost didn't happen either! Here's the short of it. Everyone boarded the flight, we were told that there was a \"weather situation\" in Vegas. They told us it could be quite a while and to go eat, drink, etc. in the airport and to be back at \"X\" time. We went for a quick bite and drink and arrived back well before \"X\" time and low and behold the plane was backing out of the gate... with all of our luggage. \u00a0They couldn't stop the plane (this I understand) and were completely unsympathetic for missing our flight (which was not our fault, btw). They very quickly refunded our flight and baggage on-the-spot. It seemed so mechanical for them that I'm sure this happens ALL THE TIME. Soon, at least 10 more people showed up that were supposed to be on our flight. This one woman was crying because she was going to miss a marathon she had trained really hard for and there was no way for her to get there. Spirit did not text, overhead page and call for us in any way. Not only did we miss this fight but we couldn't get another flight out till the next morning (and I had to use a ton of Southwest points). Our hotel - The Venetian - had already been paid for so we were out at least $300 for our room that night as well. I found out the next day that there was no \"weather situation\" in Vegas and that Spirit often says this as an excuse for not having a gate at the destination. \u00a0So not only do the suck at customer service, they are also a bunch of liars. I hope this airline shuts down soon. If they are so skimpy with the nickel and diming, who knows what their maintenance is really like. Scary. I am always early for my flights and am a very responsible person. If this could happen to me (and a bunch of other people on my flight) I really worry for other people.

Spirit on Facebook was very sorry for the customer service my mom recieved and responded my issue properly how I would expect an airline would treat their customers. Very helpful. Now trying to find the next ticket for mom to fly out in the next day or 2.Original:The worst experience of my life. I bought my mother a plane ticket to move out to california with me on orbitz. I thought \"a plane is a plane\" I didn't think they'd book my mother's flight with the first airline in the world. I now know make sure never to give a dime to spirit airlines or orbitz.com ever again, and I \u00a0encourage everyone else in the world to avoid these terrible companies for all their lives as well. My mother arrived at the airport half an hour before her flight. Spirit airlines told her that apparently their policy is they lock you out of the plane if you aren't sitting in your seat 45 minutes before your flight is supposed to take off. Apparently, they say it's written in your policy in the fine print when buying your ticket. \u00a0Never have I ever heard of a flight policy like this I've gotten on planes 10 minutes before my plane flew plenty of times. Most of the times they don't even let you on until half an hour or so before the flight. So Spirit, if you have some crazy policy you should have it written in bold print on the ticket since it's not standard. The only resolution offered was my mother was told if she gives them 100 dollars right now they could get her a flight for tomorrow(this is while the plane is sitting on the runway in view). The name plane ticket was 130. This is straight up hustling people out of their money. And why would I want to give such a terrible company more money. A company that just sent my mother home crying because she couldn't get on a plane she was in time for. Now I have to find a plane ticket, TO BUY, again, at full price. Which I will definitely not use orbitz again. Since they said they could do nothing, even though I paid the extra 2 dollars to get reimbursed if the plane ticket drops in price, and the extra 19 to make sure I could cancel after the 24 hour cancellation limit. They said I would have to deal with spirit directly. Thanks for the terrible service orbitz. Com and spirit airlines. I hope this makes it to every one of your customers and they stop dealing with both of you companies.

My boyfriend and I had been warned numerous times about how notorious Spirit is for being unreliable but those dirt cheap prices really reeled us in--the airline can afford to sell cheap because they cram as many seats as they can onto the plane (providing little to no leg room) AND charge for carry-ons, checked bags, seat selection, etc. We were flying from LAX to PDX and our flight to Portland was pleasant enough (when you overlook the fact that the plane was delayed an hour and a half). We bought the big seats so we had plenty of room and were very comfortable. The flight attendants were very nice and accommodating and their safety spiels had a few funny jokes included that I appreciated.Where things got particularly messy was our flight back home (PDX to LAX). When we woke up that morning, we already got an email notifying us that our flight scheduled for departure at 3:15 p.m. was 30min late. No problem. During breakfast, we got another email telling us departure was now pushed to 4:30 p.m. Not another hour later, we got yet another email telling us our departure was now at 7:50 p.m.--more than FOUR hours delayed. By the time we saw this, we had already returned our rental car and were on a shuttle to the airport (around 12:30 p.m.) and figured we'd just have to waste the day at the airport. Then, we get ANOTHER email telling us our flight is now 4:00 p.m., which would've made us happy if the flight hadn't been COMPLETELY CANCELLED with NO EXPLANATION just one short hour after. My boyfriend and I made our way back out to the Spirit counter, where there were DOZENS of passengers in line needing to be reassigned airlines. We wait in line for an hour and a half and are told there are no more flights from ANY airlines going to LAX until the next day. To remedy this, they offer us $7 meal vouchers. SEVEN DOLLARS for the $200+/ticket we spent. In what world does that make up for the trouble?! They advise us to stay in line if we still want to book a flight for the next day so we wait another hour in line.Thankfully, we asked to be sent to Ontario or Burbank airport when we got to the counter and they were able to get us on a flight to Ontario on Alaska Air (which offered complementary wi-fi, drinks, snacks and ON-TIME service). But even after flying to Ontario and being picked up by my mom, my boyfriend and I still had to go home and get my car to go drive to LAX and pick up his car from the QuikPark garage, where they charged him $46 for leaving his car there 4 hours after our reservation ended (our original flight with Spirit should've landed by 5 and our reservation was only until 7; we didn't get to the garage until 11 because of the whole fiasco).

They never call your name or waiting for you. Just take off without you, and your money will be gone for nothing. I also had bad experiences, arriving 4 mins later than closing time.

I have been flying since I was 12 years old and I am now 50. In all of my flying life I've never had such a horrible experience. Me and my husband were flying out on a 4.5 hour flight. This is my first and last time flying with this airline. I never thought I would have to research reviews on an airline I've never flown on until now. First of all, since when do you purchase a ticket and still have to pay for seats? Then to charge just as much for a carryon as a checked bag is ridiculous and a waste of time; which was another surprise. When boarding the plane I'd never imagine that the seats would be so uncomfortable that we'd be so annoyed the whole flight. The passenger behind me kept bumping his knees into the back of my chair the whole flight; of course I couldn't say anything because I knew he was just as uncomfortable as we were. My husband was also having a hard time because he has long legs as well and couldn't get situated.Then someone on the flight smelled so bad that I thought I would vomit! Everything from water to snacks were for sale, we couldn't even get a free drink of water. If this was disclosed from the beginning, it would allow passengers to get their own water and snacks before getting on the plane. However, because I am Vegan, I did have my own snacks but that may not be the case for everyone else. But to NOT offer water for that long of flight is outright scandalous. Despite what the very few positive reviews are saying, I would NOT agree with their optimistic attitudes!!!!! I don't care how cheap the flights are, they are still NOT that cheap to me because I still paid over $700 for round trip tickets to fly domestically and should NOT have to pay extra for a seat. I purchased our tickets from Cheaptickets.com and it's not the first time I've used this website. There was NO disclosure that this is how they work. So, naturally one would think they are paying for their seats once the tickets are purchased.This is a SCAM to me and I would urge people to stay away from them unless they really like spending extra money that wasn't budgeted into their trip."}, {"count": 458, "date": "3/6/2017", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "review": "Actually not as bad as I thought.

I've travelled on Iberia, tiger airways and even Egypt air who I thought were the amongst the worst airlines in the world, but the new honor goes to spirit airways (spiritair.com).I have never ever been on an airplane that felt like being in sub-Saharan Africa, with the air-conditioning blowing warm air, where the air quality during a flight is humid due to the passengers profusely sweating. How did they manage to keep the cabin at 90 degrees when the temperature outside is -30 is beyond me.The seats are also unique in the sense that they are beyond uncomfortable. They remind me of that time I witnessed a yogi lying on a bed of nails, except he seemed comfortable. The seats offer no recline, have no padding so your ass feels like it's resting on some bricks; with all seats crammed together; it's like being a sardine in a tin. The tray table is like a tin flap that doesn't even have enough room to hold my bottle of water.Now, this airline does not offer wifi, there's no televisions on any seat, they do not even have a monthly magazine for any entertainment. It feels like Scrooge Mcduck is the chairman of their board as they have found every singular way to be as frugal as you can imagine. They even charge for water, a hefty $4 for a bottle.The only reason I choose them is because they offered a direct route from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles when I was returning post thanksgiving.

They have unusual policies that extort customers who expect better service. It's shameful. They have probably cost people untold amounts of time and money. This is my first and last time traveling Spirit. I had heard they overcharge for baggage, but I booked anyway because it was cheapest deal on Expedia. Expedia should drop them. The first indication they're shady was when I logged on to prepay for my baggage -- I paid $20 extra for expedited check-in since I'm traveling with my small child, and when I got to the airport nobody on their staff knew what that was. So that was a complete waste of money. I was a little irritated but not super pissed. On board the flight I asked for a cranberry juice and they brought it and hit me up for $3. That was a first. I was about to refuse the drink but the flight attendant gave it to me as a courtesy. I was mildly amused, ok, yes this airline nickel and dimes you, but I just made a mental note not to bother with drinks on the flight on the way back. So for the flight back, which departed at 6:28, I logged on to check in online at 5:29. I was a minute too late and got a message that online check in was no longer available. No big deal, I'll just check in at the counter. I get through a short line and I'm told the check in is closed and they won't issue my boarding passes to let me proceed to security. I was sent to a different counter where the employee explained that the airline closed check in. The flight was not departing for 45 or 50 minutes. I would have had plenty of time to get through security and board, but they set the computer to not even let the customer service reps access check in. I was told I could pay $100 a ticket for a flight early the next morning. Other customers were inconvenienced as well. One gentleman had even been redirected to another line by a spirit employee which caused his check in to be late. I asked to speak to a manager who took a long time to arrive on the scene only to be totally unhelpful and simply robotically reiterate the airline's policy. This is a job that would prepare a person well for a career with ICE or a related occupation that requires a suppression of empathy when people's lives are being affected significantly. These are predatory policies. Customers expect a reasonable time frame for check in and this airline exploits that expectation, ultimately at its own cost because it's reputation is terrible.

Inorder to see these charges you must book direct and not through a 3rd party agent like I did.The biggest disappointment of this jouney is that we paid $250.00 extra for their best economy seats (equivalent to a business class seat but not as comfortable) and the seats do not recline, the airline removed the ability to recline your seat so you sit in an upright position your entire flight.

They forgive the 9.99 or 19.99 \"Passenger Use Fee,\" but increase all the other bits. But if they flag you and start piling cc charges on that you didn't buy, get out.

SCORE! Sure, Spirit Airlines will try to up sell you on a million and one things when you purchase tickets on their website but as long as you avoid all of them, you can get a gem of a deal. The catch for us is that we had to fly on the last flight on Saturday night and leave on the first flight on Tuesday morning and were not allowed to have any check-in or carry on baggage to get this price. You are able to bring a small personal item that was less than 16x14x12 though. I managed to pack about 3 days worth of clothes in my computer bag but a typical Jansport-sized backpack would've worked as well. TRICK 1: If you run out of space in your small personal item and would like to create more room, you can always come to the airport dressed as Fat Santa and wear 3-4 layers of clothing. It might take you some time to dress/undress going through TSA though and you may be sweating like Niagara Falls ;)Their competitive advantage is that they're an \"ultra-low cost airline\" which means you pretty much will have to pay extra for any amenity offered. Be extra hydrated before you board because a bottle of water will cost you $3. Make sure to check-in before you arrive at the airport because if you require a staff member to check you in, it is $10. If you baggage goes over their size limit at the airport, it will count as a carry on and cost $100 (yikes!). Snacks, soda, and all other food/drinks on board will run you a tab. I'm surprised they didn't have coin operated door locks on their bathrooms ;)TRICK 2: You can get extra leg room without paying extra. You have to get a little lucky though. Sometimes, when you go the Spirit terminal to get your boarding pass, they will offer you a seat on an emergency exit row and ask if you are willing to assist in case of emergency. If you agree to it, you can sit by the emergency exit rows which always have more leg room. Because you are willing to assist in case of emergency, they won't charge you extra for it. We did get this offer on one of our flights and were able to kick back and relax with that sweet leg room the whole way ;)Spirit Airlines is the youngest fleet in America so the interior on most of their planes are actually pretty new. Also, their staff was very attentive and friendly on each leg of our trip. I can tell they train them well on good costumer service and it shows.Other \"low price\" airlines will build the cost of amenities like snacks and drinks into their prices so you unknowingly pay for them, but with Spirit, you just pay for what you need.

I know this saves weight and cost, but my legs were hurting the entire flight from the moment I sat down. There is NO legroom. If you're a child, there is legroom, but for a 6' tall adult, I could not put my legs straight in front of me and I felt like I had to push my back into the seat to keep my knees from bumping into the seat in front of me. The seats were the exact width of my butt and my neighbors butt, so our butts/hips were touching. The thing is, lots of people have wider shoulders than hips, so my neighbors and I had to sit at an angle in order to keep our shoulders from pushing on each other! For a 5 hour flight, this is painful. I wish Spirit would take the $10-$20 you pay for picking your seat and use it to upgrade all their seats.

After the second flight I'm thoroughly positive I will never fly with them again. Let me break it down for you. Let's start with customer service-CRAAAAAAPPPPY. If you like being sent to Indian for literally everything-this is your airline. \u00a0I have a service dog and so I call ahead to make sure she is registeredon my itinerary as well as my known traveler number for TSA PRE CHECK. I also need to make sure I have an aisle seat as my service dog is a full size Boxer.

You then have to wait in a line (because the third kiosk you use that finally works because he first two are broken, rejects you when you're 40 minutes early) their policies force you to miss you flight (again TSA precheck over here) and THEN THEY CHARGE YOU $100 to switch your flight. So, next issue...I was assigned to the third isle seat to help accommodate my large dog and as soon as I board the connecting flight they forced upon me, the airline stewardess decided that my seat was too small for my dog and shoved me into another seat, then she announced my dog? Weird. Then moved me again to freaking window seat claiming that my dog couldn't fit under my chair???? She sure as heck wasnt going to fit into a window seat any better. I was pissed at this point. The seat next to me had someone assigned but lucky for me they missed their flight (I'm sorry for them) so I was able to love a bit.Needless to say, this airline is plain awful.

Our family of 4 flies spirit every other month & I use it even more frequently for business. We have only ever once had a flight cancelled because the pilot felt too tired to fly. I was super grateful he had that kind of self awareness. Yes travelling with two small kids across country took 36 hours instead of 12 but that was not a spirit problem. PROS: I love that spirit charges for carry on bags because boarding and unloading are always faster. I love that there are no chargers because my kids read books or sleep instead of charging their Gameboys. I love that the flight attendants are so kind. I may be in the minority but I like the metal seats, I find them comfortable and am grateful to not have someone reclining back and smooshing me. Love the no drink cart thing, my knees always get beaten up by those darned hard metal boxes. Awesome that they remind you 10 minutes before seat belt sign so you can make that last minute trip to bathroom or stand up and keep circulation moving.Our family flew for the weekend to Denver and rountrip with bags and taxes it was less than 400 bucks. On the way home they did a random giveaway to someone who had a ticket hidden in their tray.CONS: I did have a hard time printing return boarding passes ahead of time before we travelled. Also, I wish when you book a carry on for a round trip flight the system assumed you wanted it both ways. After the fact it was still only 36 bucks to fix it and the round-trip tickets were still under 400.

I had to go out, grab my luggage, and then do the same process I had already done in LA. Usually when I make stops I do t do that I just go to my next plane.

Well, I had to payed for my luggage otherwise I was going to missed my flight. Coming back from Atlanta I paid $42 for my luggage and I made 2 stops (one at New Orleans and another one in Las Vegas) I didn't paid for any of those, which it was what I tried to explained to the girl in New Orleans that I didn't had to paid for my luggage at any stopped.

I load up on snacks before I go to the airport and I just suck it up and buy a large bottle of water at the airport.

No annual fee the first year ($59 afterwards), $100 cash back after you spend $500, and 15,000 miles (which for me pays for a roundtrip ticket from lax to dc). Once you run out of your miles, it's probably best to just book with your standard airline.

I had a flight that was delayed overnight hence a refund was issued along with some vouchers (which appeared in my email for $50 each). The math of the refund did not make any sense. When I book my next flight using the vouchers, I can only redeem $8. Why the discrepancy? Per Spirit rep, it's based on the \"bare fare.\" Why claim I can redeem $50 and not a % of my booking? Even with their explanation, they couldn't explain to me the calculation of the final prices. Auditing the charges was a pain.Overall, I would recommend Spirit to people who are always on the go -- expert travelers. Not worth it at all for those who travel 2-3 times a year. I always expect some sort of issue with Spirit so if you do decide to fly with them, be mentally prepared."}, {"count": 890, "date": "1/19/2018", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Not much of a deal, be careful, especially booking online, they will nickel and dime you.

But the time I was helped by a new agent it was 8:40 and TSA practically empty since it was right in front of us I explained and pleaded with the lady that I had to get on this flight to get to my children since I needed to get to them since I had no hotel or rental since I am supposed to be on this flight. No, she said by this time they closed the door and computer would not let her get me in even though I would haul ass to get to the gate since I still had time!

They tell me it's because 'a pilot didn't show up'. So you cancel simultaneously flights to New Orleans, LA, Niagra Falls, Chicago, etc bc one pilot didn't show up? Ok.Hundreds of us are directed (inefficiently, stupidly, and unsuccessfully) into a line at the ticketing counter. 10 minutes into standing in some line against the wall, some of us begin to notice that we're just being ignored in a line in a corner, while new customers just waltz right into the regular ticketing line.

They tried to put non locals at some 2 star hotel, and said screw you to Florida residents, even those who lived hours away. They gave me $21 in meal vouchers, which covered a piece of candy and a bottle of water, and then no other vendors would accept the vouchers. I booked my own hotel bc I didn't want to stay a roach motel, and therefore had to pay for my own cab to the hotel. They gave me an $80 voucher for my cab ride to Miami the next afternoon. I'd never been to Florida before, so I asked them how long it would take to get from Fort Lauderdale to Miami. They said, '20-30 mins'. Come to find out the next day, it's more like 45 mins to an hour. So I nearly miss my flight, get there and hand the yellow cab driver the $80 voucher. The trip was $86. He doesn't accept vouchers. I show him the voucher, that says, must be used with yellow cab. He says sorry, yellow cab doesn't accept spirit vouchers. So, at least we know yellow cab is smarter than I am. I get to ticketing and have to wait forever to get a boarding pass, bc spirit never emailed me one for the new flight.

I have never written a review before. However, I think this is worth me informing the general public because I am sure it will affect every 3rd person who purchases a ticket from Spirit Airlines. I understand the price might be cheap, but this company needs to be sued for the trickery. They are a 2 Billion Dollar Industry, therefore, they don't care about the consumer, they want money to grown thus as a Southwest did. Unfortunately, they are going the scandalous route to get there. 1) I was unable to print my boarding pass from home 1 hr and 20 mins before my flight. During one of my 3 attempts, I was asked if I would like to voluntarily give my seat up. I stated NO. I tried 3 times, the paper version and email barcode. The policy states you have 1hr to check-in online. The message that continued to pop up is check in at the counter.What, I found out is they bumped me of my flight (gave my seat away) it could have been to someone that paid more as prices continued to rise. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02) Once, I arrived at the airport I was told they cannot print off my boarding pass after 45 mins and I missed that so-called time frame by 3 minutes. \u00a0The attendant confirmed I attempted to check-in online however it was unsuccessful. It was only unsuccessful because they gave my seat away and want to get more money out of me.3) I was offered the next flight for $99 more. I have flown just about every airline international and domestically and all airlines have attempted to rectify or compensate. They blocked me from checking in online. I have read the U.S. Department of Transporation \"Bumping and Overselling\" guidelines. They have the right to do this, however, they internally prohibited me. I thought it was a computer glitch but I continued to receive correspondents informing me of the flight update to the same email I should have received my boarding pass.4) Of course, they gave a number to call I live 6 mins from the airport. I could have gone back and still made my flight, but they continued to sell me more. They said go back to the counter knowing the cut off time has passed. Told me a lot of unnecessary information, but what was clear after struggling with the accent is at the counter $99, on the phone would be $300 and online would be $280. There was no empathy I was told someone would call me within 48 hrs and there is nothing else they could do after 1 and 38 minutes over the phone. Part of the issue was I couldn't understand the supervisor along with her trying to talk around the issue, however suggesting me pay for another flight. Meanwhile, I continued to get updates to the same email address regarding the flight arrival change. 5) I called customer care again in disbelief that nothing could be done. I was, therefore, told a different story. That my return flight had some issues, I don't understand how that hinder me from departing, but I tried to make sense of it, maybe they didn't want me to fly out if my return had issues \"why wasn't a correspondent emailed to me\" therefore giving me the chance to fix that before take off. The attendant told me at the counter that my return was fine and that all I needed to do was rebook the departure for the $99. Now, I can see they are fishing for excuses. Due to the accent, I spent another 30 minutes on the phone to make sure I documented all lies. After struggling to understand I was put on hold. I was the Operation Manager at LA Fitness and after seeing how the company and sales counselors bamboozle members, I was well aware of what was happening next. The customer rep. needed to consult the supervisor of what to say to me. She continued to put me on hold and finally said to me I was a \"no-show\". She, therefore, proceeded to talk about the past flight. She was not conscious of the conversation at all, so I asked where she was located because it was now the next day and this needs to be rectified. She stated the Philippines, but the Philippines is 12hrs \u00a0ahead of Eastern Standard time, so let's move on in the conversation. Once we got past that point she started to inform me of the cost to re-book, I received an email that my flight has arrived at my final destination. \u00a0That really upset me and the Customer rep. never spoke of the return flight as an issue again.6) This airline is ridiculous I documented 3 different stories. I never had a computer glitch. They gave my ticket away and never rebutted my statement once I put it together and refused to compensate or reimburse. Just continued to push sales. I advise if you book make sure your check-in is confirmed 2 hrs early at least, I have never had this problem with any other airlines. I wouldn't take the risk to save money unless you really have the money to lose because you come out paying more. \u00a0 I called 4 times and they said they can't refund because I was a no-show, not late, but a no-show, do not forget the fact that they refused my check-in,with in time."}, {"count": 1054, "date": "5/25/2016", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "There should be a way to give a negative star rating. \u00a0Spirit airlines operates on a F*** U pay us policy.

They're nicer because there shouldn't be any surprises that add stress to a getaway. The standard in airlines is all-inclusive (to an extent). The bar is set to allow one free carry-on, a complimentary snack and soda, and reclining seats.This message is directly off of Spirit Airline's menu card: \"We add more seats to our planes because when we fly with more people, the cost per person goes down. Our seats are simple: they don't recline, so you don't wind up with someone's head in your lap. And we don't have Wi-Fi or video, so be sure to download a movie to your phone or tablet next time. A little cozier setting and fewer expensive extras mean lower fares for you.\"I hate to say this as it sounds pretentious, but that statement is almost what separates us from third-world countries. Okay, so not really as we're flying a a jet across the country. But still, why try so hard to sell us on crappy service to save a few bucks?The whole reason we flew Spirit is because they offered a direct round trip flight to Cleveland and back for $200. We've never seen that kind of airfare before at that rate to Cleveland. So my fianc\u00e9 and I booked the flight via Travelocity. What we didn't know or expect was a multitude of charges to follow. Granted, the charges added up to still be less than their competitors. But it was an unpleasant surprise at the time of check-in. Let me break down those costs.3 of us traveled (me, my fianc\u00e9, and my step-daughter):Carry-On bag: $451st checked bag: $402nd checked bag: $50Printed boarding pass at check-in counter: $10 per passChoosing your own seats: $16-$50 per seatSince I'd not experienced a check-in like this before, I was almost unprepared to pay the rates they were asking. It costed $145 just to check us all in. I printed my own boarding passes from home to save $30, and I had to choose seats as I didn't want my little one to randomly sit between what I feared to be two gross dudes. So I paid $20 per seat to make sure we all sat together. The rest of my $145 was spent on bags.Now, where their seating did some damage was that we flew a red-eye flight. Since their seats don't recline, I struggled to turn my neck to the left for the next few days as I slept sitting up incorrectly. This was upsetting to say the least as I was visiting home as a vacation and ended up feeling like I was in recovery.Their staff is nice. But they do charge you for practically everything. They even call this practice \"frill control\" as though their passengers are fed up with paying for services they don't want like complimentary beverages, a free carry-on bag, and in-flight entertainment. Did they do a study and find that two people complained about that? I doubt it. It's just a marketing ploy to get away with crappy service.Sadly, I'll probably fly them again and suffer a bit of discomfort as they're one of the few directs that go between LAX and CLE.

On a roundtrip from Los Angeles to Chicago, I paid $216.18 per person. For my one checked bag and one carry-on bag, the bag fees piled $150 on top of this. Ouch. So that became $366.18 for my seat. So much for being a budget airline.I found the airplane seating extremely cramped and uncomfortable, worse than anyone else I've flown with, perhaps suitable for a short hop commuter flight or a LA to Vegas or San Francisco flight, but not halfway across the continental United States.I really took issue with their marketing. It felt almost Orwellian, pushing the \"virtues\" of their \"no frills\" business model. Forcing down my throat notions of how much money I \"saved\" not having things \"bundled\". They said \"we don't make you pay for spotty wi-fi\". (In most airplanes with Wi-Fi, I have relatively good experiences. Worked great on Phillippine Airlines, and JetBlue.) I could make political comparisons but it's not worth it. Suffice to say, I left with no illusions that somehow I had been the benefactor of the cost cutting that airline did. I ended up buying a couple of alcoholic beverages to just dull the pain of the cramped seat, and they were quite overpriced ($7-$8). No \"savings\" here.The seat on the flight out was in very bad repair (otherwise a standard airline seat, tampered with by the airline - not very well - to prevent reclining), and on the return it was a newer plane with crummy plastic seats with no ability to recline. There was something they jokingly referred to a \"tray table\" which had the same profile as a letter envelope and couldn't hold any size tray. When they said \"put your tray tables up and seats in upright position\" I told them \"there aren't any! - and you can't adjust the seats\".The flight attendants took some amount of interest in harassing individuals who had been waiting to use the lavatory, repeatedly announcing to not queue or congregate near the lavatory. Don't know if this is FAA bullshit or Spirit bullshit, but there's no way this isn't bullshit.

I had concerns considering all the negative comments and reviews. I chose the flight due to the low airfare. I read their guidelines, watched videos, messaged other Yelp reviewers and even reached out to their customer service via email and Facebook messenger. \u00a0Seems excessive, but I don't like surprises. My main concern was the baggage. I didn't purchase additional carry-on or check-in, so I wanted to make sure my bag was not going to be too large by their standards and be charged a horrendous fee if I exceeded by an inch or so. My bag was cloth, so it was flexible. I never placed it into their sizing bins for fear it would exceed the limit. I just waited to see if someone would say something and I anticipated the highest fee at the gate. Surprisingly no one even questioned my bag. It was a little long to fit under my feet, but the flight attendants didn't say anything. Phew! Spirit Airlines has no hidden fees. They are all displayed on their website in text and in audio (video). \u00a0It is restated in emails after you purchase your ticket. \u00a0I received multiple emails from Spirit from point of sale up until arrival of flight. They offered every opportunity for me to purchase the additional items at incremental rates up until the flight. I downloaded their mobile app. I was able to view my information and check in. My only complaint, which I did communicate to Spirit via Facebook messenger, was once I checked in via the mobile app and tried to view the flight information about an hour or so before my flight, the flight information disappeared. Luckily both times I took a screenshot of my boarding pass and was able to use it. On their site, it does say they charge a $10 fee to print boarding pass at airport. However, I think that is only if you use an actual representative opposed to the kiosk. I didn't use the kiosk but that may have been free. Again anticipating a problem, I approached the representative at the gate to let her know my information on the mobile app disappeared and I couldn't access the boarding pass but that I did have a screenshot of it. She asked if I wanted a copy. Expecting her to charge me I said \"no, tha....\". Before I could finish saying thank you, she printed it and handed it to me. No charge. Back to my mobile app complaint... I sent my message via Facebook messenger at 11:57am and a representative from Spirit Airlines replied by 12:03pm. That was amazing to me. I honestly didn't expect a reply and definitely not within minutes of sending a message. They apologized and informed me they would have their Technicians review the mobile app. As far as the actual flight, sure there are no free drinks or snacks offered but it was a 3 hour flight so I bought a bottle of water at the airport shop and had accumulated snacks throughout my vacation so I was set. They do offer drinks and snacks for a fee on the flight. Again, it was mentioned on website and email. The seats were not that comfortable but I can never get comfortable in an airplane seat anyway. The walkway seemed a little wider than some airlines I have been on. The seats didn't have much padding and do not recline. If it is an issue, take a small towel or sit on a jacket or sweater. The return flight was slightly delayed but I received notifications via email prior to my flight. So I was prepared. This review may seem lengthy but I hope it helps someone considering whether to fly Spirit or not. Many reviews complained about the guidelines and fees, but nothing was hidden.

But I'm gonna write it anyway to warn all my fellow friends and families to NOT DO IT. THEY'RE CHEAP FOR A REASON. BECAUSE EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM IS DISASTROUS. I read reviews, I read guidelines, and made sure everything was OK prior to boarding. I thought \"hey, its only 1hr flight and I have a high tolerance, why not the cheap flight?\" WRONG....NOT WORTH IT.

MEASURE YOUR BAGS BEFORE BOARDING or do the pre-purchase of bags. (this dude had a bag that was a little bit bigger than the measurement and the front desk told him to leave and that he couldnt get on the plane after he said, \"Are you serious?\")-Count on Spirit to be absolutely LATE for take offs. Like 1-2 hours late AT LEAST. I flew from OAK to LA (1hr delay), then LA to OAK (4hr delay). THESE ARE THE TIMES WE SPEND WAITING ON THE FRIGGEN AIRPLANE ALL BOARDED ALREADY WITH THE HUNDREDS OF PASSENGERS JUST SITTING THERE WAITING FOR IT TO TAKE OFF. Invest in better planes man. - Good Customer service? HA. Dont even expect to find any here. They are all RUDE..... - My last encounter was from LA to OAK on a Tuesday night. I had work on Wednesday. On top of delaying the flight already for 1hr 40min than original boarding time, they had the entire flight of BOARDED (people and luggages) wait for 2.5 hours on the plane for them to fix the \"computer problem.\" We were just asking the flight attendant what's going on and how much longer because NO ONE WAS TELLING US WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON. But they rudely replied, it's the same answer as an hour ago, we don't know. -___- Alright, so done with you. ALL OF YOU. Then they kicked us all off the plane and said, \"Flight's cancelled\" OK, Spirit. Then they made the entire flight of passengers line up to book for the next day at 6am. Which was obviously QUICKLY gone since there were over 80 of us. DO J'ALL NOT GOT ANOTHER PLANE FOR BACKUP OR SOMETHING?- Lack of phone etiquettes. After the entire situation of ALL the passengers just stuck at LAX since they made us wait until 11pm, there were no other airlines flying out. So I called the company to cancel the ticket back to OAK completely since I dont trust their shaddy a$$ anymore. I told the representative the situation and I wanted the compensation for making me miss my flight back to OAK, my ride back to SF, an entire day of work tomorrow by refunding my tickets or paying for my flight with another airline. She was like, \"uh talk to someone at the counter. i cant do much for you over the phone. bye.\" YES... because I would really wait in this line for another 2 hours because it was already 12:00AM the next day and you've had me wait at the airport since fricken 6:30pm.

Part 1: Flight to destination: Welcome to sitting on a plane at the gate for over an hour with the crew just hanging out doing NOTHING but socializing with each other, while not explaining to you or any of the other passengers why the plane sits at the gate not leaving, while you --- the customer -- sit like cattle trapped in a pen. This might be a crazy concept, but, how about informing your customer why the plane they paid to fly on ISN'T FLYING!!?When asked by various customers why we're not leaving, the crew turn irritatedly from their personal conversations to say, they \"don't know\" or \"it's a busy night\". Wow!!! Really?!?! Not an \"I'm sorry\", or a \"Thank you for your patience.\"?Part 2: Return flight: (Gets worse) Let's talk about the flight attendant who couldn't be bothered to stand and welcome us, but instead while we all stand in a looong line waiting to board we watch her sit down in a wheelchair (intended for a needy passenger) and literally wave us on , sardonically dismissing us with an \"I really can't be bothered\" attitude. Does ANYONE in an executive position for this airline EVER fly the routes surreptitiously, as a spotter, to review the poor quality of customer service their airline provides?!?! You can't fix something if you don't know it's broken, and the system of customer service on these flights is BROKEN!!Staff won't report each others unprofessionalism, and the company is not bothering to self monitor, so instead you get flight crews who KNOW they can be this dismissive of their customers because NO ONE is going to hold them ACCOUNTABLE.The airport boarding crew felt compelled to come in and socialize once all the passengers were in the cabin and waiting to take seats. The airport crew and the cabin crew were cracking jokes and laughing and not at all present to help passengers get situated, not even some of the elderly passengers who seemed to be having difficulty. They never even noticed them because they were so completely self-involved. Then it got really weird when the cabin crew and airport boarding crew began hugging each other goodbye and telling each other how much they were going to miss each other!!!What!!! It was a two hour flight!!(Do they know something none of the rest of us do, but should....??)Most obvious and disturbing on both of these flights was how completely absorbed the cabin staff was with talking about things that are not relevant to work. A few snippets include \"how often to you get that wasted?\", \"Damn, I just got a new car and it got keyed! I know it was my ex!\", \"whaddya, wanna do tomorrow?\", \"I sure love water sports! What about you?\", \"have you tried that raspberry habanero yogurt, yet?!? Oh, it's so good!!!\" They avoid eye contact and are therefore deliberately unresponsive to customer need.One young woman on the staff actually said \"Well, I'm gonna go walk the aisle and do some work.\" And one of the other male staff members said to her \"No! No! Don't go do that! Talk to us!!!\" And her reply was, Why? You guys aren't even talking to me!\" He replied, \"Don't go!! We will! We will!\"The immaturity of this crew is unbelievable!All this childishness has been going on the whole flight!!Here is a cabin FULL of passengers and after more than an hour after beverage service not one of the, at least, four cabin personnel have chosen to get up from their chairs in the front and rear of the cabin to bother picking up our trash, to ask us if they can get us anything or even walk the aisle. They've done NOTHING except sit on their butts for a two hour coffee break. This is clearly an ENTIRE staff who has NEVER been trained in customer service! Additionally, they exhibit NO work ethic!I say this because not a one of them is attempting to maintain even a hint of professional decorum.They are COMPLETELY involved in their personal dialogue without any realization or care, for how poorly they manage the customer experience.After these two hellacious experiences I feel very comfortable saying that this lack of professionalism clearly DEFINES this airline!! Why? Because not one of these crew members seems to comprehend what it means to be a \"steward\" or a \"stewardess\". They clearly perceive their job to be: WATCH passengers get on the plane, WATCH passengers get off the plane. Everything in between is just an \u00a0extended chance to chat about their personal lives. Can you imagine going to a restaurant, or aboard a cruise ship, even into a Starbucks and the ENTIRE time that the staff is supposed to be attentive to your needs they are instead sitting off to the side in the establishment's front and the back having shift long breaks!?If this is the state of the cabin crew (OMG!) what does it say about the flight crew!?And we're supposed to trust these poorly trained, unprofessional, dismissive child-like brats with our safety.... and our lives!!!"}, {"count": 1211, "date": "6/4/2018", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Spirit airlines is the worst airlines hands down.

Purchasing bags in advance is a MUST, and yes, you should definitely be prepared for a cheap purchase experience. You actually DO get a cheap flying experience!Cons: It feels cheap from the moment you go to the line; you have to pay to check in- REALLY!? and staff don't seem happy, the vibe from them was one of drudgery-- check it out. Now when flying 20,000 miles or more above the earth you don't want to feel like they've cut back on safety and it DOES feel like it's a shell with seats. And, the plane totally gives you the impression that it's extremely slimmed down, and you think, can it be as safe as possible-- no cost savings is worth your life. A cheap car rental is one thing, but flying for 4-5 hours and feeling like it's a cheap plane-- isn't a good feeling. Plus, I have to say it, the type of person flying, sorry, NOT good-- and, add to the mix babies on the flight and shoot me! Yes, it was spring break, and I was flying out of Fort Lauderdale, FL, but it was also really ghettofied from the passengers and the Spirit Air staff. I flew from LA to Costa Rica for $90 O/W, (NOT including flight fees, luggage, $60 cost for the $9 Club), a good price, no doubt; however, this flight had really long layovers (4 hrs). I traveled for 20 hrs and I felt very exhausted when I arrived home.Flight charges can be unclear, I had to pay another $30 exit fee in the Costa Rica airport, but I was only making a connection there, so the basic fight cost became $120 (R/T $300 incl. luggage and those fine print hidden additional fees) Note: the over all additional costs can be progressive for basic services normally included-- so watch out! Also, the attendants are constantly apologizing for missing the mark; every time I've flown, the flight was mostly out of food, the seats don't recline, have poor padding and were VERY uncomfortable (my back pain was terrible), you get half a metal tray (which feels really dangerous if there's a crash it'll cut your body in half) and layovers are crazy long when flying from LA to Central America. Yes, it can be cheap, but you're getting such poor customer service and comfort on long flights, the experience feels cheap and isn't at all enjoyable.Did I save money, yes, about $150-- was it worth it? Yes and no. In the end, it really wasn't worth it, because my overall travel experience was really horrible.

We entered the Spirit line about 8:15am. We waited in line , and finally got to the counter at 9:02, after watching 2 Spirit airline agents drinking coffee, and chatting while not helping any of the Spirit customers waiting in the long line. The Spirit counter agent pulled up our reservation and told us we could not board due to it being 45 minutes before flight. We were 2 minutes late he said. Really? After we waited in their line for almost an hour. No announcement was made to give consideration to people waiting in their long lines, with flights about to close. We asked to speak with a supervisor and were told it would be an hour wait. When we asked why so long, the counter agent said they had 5 flights on the ground and everyone was busy. Obviously that would be after our flight had left. Spirit airline apparently was severely understaffed!Spirit did not have another flight to offer until the next morning. This would not make it possible for our son to attend his interview. At the counter they offered us $388 credit out of our $788.

They are poorly staffed, and extremely confusing to deal with, and we are out $788 dollars.We will be posting this on every review site we can find, we want to help anyone thinking of flying with Spirit Airlines avoid this costly experience. Food for thought...if they are so poorly staffed and \u00a0understaffed at the counter, and at call center, are they any better staffed with other parts of their operation?"}, {"count": 1280, "date": "8/26/2017", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Don't fly with these jerks.

This airlines sucks! Avoid at all costs and don't even waste the time reading anymore of this! Just stay away!This airline is hands down the absolute worst carrier currently operating in the United States. I have had the opportunity to experience it first hand in several cities and I ask myself why I keep going back. Honestly, I am not always the one booking it and I have no say in the matter, but when I do I avoid at all costs. -Awful flights that feel as if the pilots are new on the job or operating a plane that needs to be checked out. I understand turbulence and and such, but no excuse for not changing altitude or a rough landing or takeoff a with dramatic movements every which way. They are old planes that should be taken out of service. I have flown in nicer planes in third world countries!-Very unfriendly staff! It is like everyone hates their job and they are in no way able to try and assist you. Have had issues with planes being late or sitting on them waiting for takeoff and there is never valid reasons this occurs and never people working there that seem apologetic. Like making you board a plane in 10 minutes and then making you sit there for an hour before take off.-Zero comfort! If it is not already bad that you have a awful ride and unfriendly people that are helping you... You get to sit on top of the person next to you with zero leg room \u00a0and no entertainment options. Total crap in every way!-Cheap and not inexpensive! These two words seem similar, but they are not at all. This airlines always has the lowest price and even days up until traveling they offer this, but remember to add the cost of water, carry on bags and a number of other add on a that make absolutely no sense. They also have a Scam ring with their supposed saving club. Sign up and even if you unsubscribe it keeps you there and you are required to call after you see it on your credit card statement.

Everything went smoothly at the airport with exception to other travelers holding up the line because they weren't aware of the rules/charges.

I am missing a family event now, was fine with complying with your (pretty ridiculous) nickle-and-diming form of fare generating...I was fine with that so long as my flight was on time...and if it wasn't, there would at least be REASONS and EXPLANATIONS regarding so.

The TSA portion of our airport experience was predictably awful, but we ran from the security checkpoint to our gate and were excited to see that the plane was still there. Unfortunately, even though they had just allowed a passenger to get on the plane, they decided to draw the line with us and the 5 subsequent people who arrived at the gate shortly after us. We continued to argue for about 10 minutes before being told that we would have to head back down to the ticket area to file a complaint. That would mean that if we were to get another flight, we would have to go back through security and deal with TSA again. Thankfully, the supervisor Brandon was able to refund us and seemed to understand that the airline and its employees had dropped the ball. He did the best he could in a tough situation, but it isn't enough to make me ever consider flying spirit again.

I've never had a worse experience than the few encounters I've had with Spirit airline. I've been meaning to write a review for years now, but I foolishly continued to give Spirit a chance to redeem themselves. Silly of me, I know. I understand that you get what you pay for, but by the time this airline is done raping your pockets, you might as well had paid for a quality flight with Southwest or Delta. RACIST! Weeks ago my boyfriend was returning home to Cleveland from LAX. I dropped him off -I live here in LA- and as soon as I was readying to leave, he calls and tells me he can't board. He was told by the spirit employee that the flight was full and he would have to pay $100 to catch the next flight. My boyfriend is a very passive person and doesn't like conflict. I too try to avoid conflict at all cost but I could not wrap my head around this. He paid for his flight months ago, so why should he have to pay anything additional when spirit overbooked this flight. At this point, I'm still calm. Surely if we talk to this employees superior, we can work something out. Wrong I was. Not only did they say he would have to pay $100 but he wouldn't arrive in Cleveland until Wednesday. It was MLK day. So a Monday. Meaning he would miss school and work. While waiting for a superior, a white woman approaches the counter to check in for the same exact flight going to CLE. With no hesitation, the employee checks the woman in, takes her bag, and the woman proceeds to security. The only difference I could see was race. This woman did not indicate to the clerk that she had a seat reserved or any elite status. When the woman walked away, I turned to the clerk and asked why does she get to go? The clerk looks at me, tilts her head, and smirks. Her supervisor did not try to make any accommodations and condoned the employees behavior. When I asked why he has to pay when he is not at fault, they referred to the terms and conditions. I was appalled. Fast forward to 02/09/2018. I am late for my flight. That is my fault, and has nothing to do with spirit airline. I walk up to the clerk with no intentions of making my current flight. I ask when the next flight is. She says tomorrow. That will be $100 please. Okay the flight was 206.00. $45 to add a bag. One way. I am upset at this point but I realize rules are rules and I was late. I take a deep breath and take $100 out of my wallet. She then says, we don't accept cash but. No exceptions. At this point I am overwhelmed with anger. I have had so many bad encounters with this airline and have finally decided not to fly with them anymore. They find a way to get their money and their customer service is terrible. The plane is small and all snacks cost. They don't care about their customers and they don't allow free carry ons anymore. You will be charged $55 at boarding if you try to bypass them. It does not matter the size. Spare yourself the agony. It's not worth saving the few extra dollars because in actuality you don't.

Bring one large empty water bottle per person; fill it at a drinking fountain after passing TSA. \u00a0(Most good airports have fountains with spigots specifically for filling tall bottles; unfortunately, my airport--LAX--is not one of the good ones.) \u00a0We bring powdered lemonade along and mix it into the bottle. \u00a0If you don't bring water and get thirsty, a mere 8 oz. bottle will run you 3 bucks on the plane.2. Bring food that keeps and is tasty at room temp, such as sandwiches. \u00a0The only food offered onboard is various snacks, which don't constitute a meal and are therefore unsatisfying--and can cost over $20 for a \"value\" box.3. If you take a long flight and plan to sleep, book early and bring a small pillow, a small blanket and reserve one of the front seats, which cost $75 more but may be worth it. \u00a0There is no First or Business class on Spirit, but the front 4 seats are wider, have far more legroom and recline somewhat, as where the rest of the seats do not.4. Bring a laptop or handheld device for entertainment if you have one (cell phones cannot be used in flight at all); otherwise bring a book if you happen to be literate (which is increasingly unlikely with each passing year in America), some playing cards, a coloring book or comics if you are illiterate or play mumbletipeg with a plastic fork to pass the time, because Spirit offers nothing for entertainment, other than the safety procedures (more to come on this). 5. Bring a sense of humor. \u00a0We've only flown round trip to and from Chicago, and both flight crews were bordering on hilarious. \u00a0The safety procedures had me chuckling in both directions. \u00a0We were very happy with the flight crews.Now we did have a delay of about 15 minutes on our first flight; but the second flight made up for that: the pilot out of Chicago might have been on the NASCAR circuit at some time, because he taxied at about 80 mph the whole way, slowing down only to turn and then only as much as he had to without passengers straining against their seatbelts, and took off without even a slight hesitation. \u00a0I think he may have cut off a plane or two in his haste, for which I was grateful.The bottom line is this: as long as you know what to expect and are prepared--as any itinerant wanderer SHOULD be--Spirit is my #1 choice for domestic flights."}, {"count": 1451, "date": "2/3/2017", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "For what I have used Spirit for, I feel like they deserve more credit than what is given.

She denies my request and I'm a little bummed out. Not upset by any means. She then tells me that it's $99 to catch the next flight out. Wtf is pretty much how I felt.

I decide I need to pay this $99 or else I will get stuck buying another ticket for $2-300. I walk back up to the counter and wait patiently as she pretends to not see me standing there. ( no exaggeration because there was only 2 customers waiting and 3 reps working). She asked if there was something I needed and I replied with can I please pay that $99. She asked how do I want to pay and I handed her $100 cash. Sorry we do not take cash she said. She told me there was a currency exchange machine to pay for a prepaid cc.

Most importantly, the company offers cheap airfare at the expense of virtually every amenity possible, and looks for any opportunity to add additional fees to the extent that your discount is really anything but.If you'd care to read on, here's how my booking experience went. The airfare was cheap, and I was excited. Once I went to check into the flight, that's where my booking experience went awry. The airline highlights their $9 fare club, an opportunity to pay once to save on future fees. I signed up for the service. However, the two times this applied to my flight, the website was experiencing errors, and the discount was unable to process.The website is also incredibly jumbled, and it was very difficult to even get to my boarding pass. Most importantly, when you do attempt to check out, the \"continue\" button is actually a button that adds additional services to your flight. To continue to check out with just what you have in your cart, you have to scroll down and locate a much smaller, hidden \"continue without perks\" button. It's an insulting feature to include in a major corporation in the year 2015. Don't be surprised when checking in when the weight of a bag is 40lbs either. Most airlines allow for 50lbs, but certainly not Spirit. They do what they want. Their slogan, \"Less Money, More Go,\" really should be \"Less Money, More Money just later that you may not notice.\" Don't bother trying to bring two bags with you when you get to the gate either. There's a $100 fee if your bag is too bag. And they will check.The aircraft itself was unsurprisingly subpar as well. The seats do not recline, the tray table is inexplicably small, as is the pouch for containing items. The aircraft does not offer anything free to consume during the flight either. To just get water costs money, a policy that may actually be illegal.The bottom line is this. An airline that offers cheaper rates for people who need to save to travel should be looking out for lower income families, and offer a few cut corners or inconveniences to allow for cheaper flying. Instead, Spirit capitalizes on the consumer's potential to miss a hidden fee to make a flying experience that's just as expensive as a luxury competitor by the time you've landed at your destination. I'd highly recommend just paying $50 extra for virtually any other airline, knowing fully that your rate will likely be cheaper by the time you're done with your flight."}, {"count": 1562, "date": "7/22/2017", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "FAIR WARNING:I was set to fly to Minnesota,Friday @ 5:30.

We all know how spirit works. It's the bare bones in exchange for a cheaper flight. We sign up for that. What I didn't sign up for was having my flight delayed 8 times. This 45 minute flight to Vegas got continually pushed back to a 9 hr delay until it was straight up cancelled. For \"mechanical problems\" I don't buy it. Knowing spirit, they probably didn't sell enough seats to make money on the flight so they strung people along all day by gradually delaying it many times. As if that weren't annoying enough, once the flight was cancelled, I called the number on the website to speak with someone to resolve this. She said I could either A) be rebooked on a spirit flight the next day at 6am or B) go to the airport and talk to the ticket counter people at Spirit to have them rebook me on another airline for no additional charge. Sweet. A solution. the lady on the phone even refunded my ticket price. I verified with her that I would definitely be able to get a new flight on another carrier if i go to LAX. She assures me that yes, of course. \u00a0That's the kicker. She refunded my ticket price, which in Spirit lingo means she cancelled my ticket. I get to the airport and wait in line to talk to a spirit ticket counter agent, just like everyone else who was on this flight. The ticket counter agent is unable to locate my reservation (because phone lady cancelled it), which is necessary to get a new ticket on another airline. Effing seriously. After keeping me on my toes all day until canceling the flight, the Spirit phone person cancels my reservation thinking she's helping. \u00a0Long story short I lost my cool for all of 5 seconds and demanded them to figure it out and buy me a new ticket, as promised, since they were the ones who cancelled the flight and PROMISED they would hook it up. After getting a top dog of spirit on the phone and proving to them I was on that cancelled flight through email records, they purchased me a new one-way ticket on Delta. I pace walked from terminal 3 to 5. Funniest thing is, after all this, the Delta flight I was rebooked on ended up getting delayed an hour. \u00a0Obviously that's out of Spirit Airline's realm entirely. But sometimes you just gotta laugh at the hand you were dealt and just work with it. Oh and deep breaths. It works WONDERS! PS- I'm now sitting on the delta plane en route to Vegas. Yes. Finally. What a day. And FYI Spirit, I will never book you again to even take advantage of the $69 you credited me for the cancellation and massive inconvenience. Laugh.

They used to have strange flash sales with $9 flights, their fares are consistently at least $50 less than other major carriers.

This is the third time my husband and/or I have basically gotten screwed by Spirit. Long story short, I'm still waiting for him to get home to LA from Ft. Lauderdale. Unlucky for him, he was on the last flight of the night 6/14/15. Original takeoff time was around 8:45pm. After delaying the flight twice, it was ultimately cancelled hours later with no reason or excuse. Most of the time signage for the delays were posted, the ticketing desk at the gate was unattended leaving passengers with no idea what was going on. Worse over, since it was the last flight of the night, your option was basically to sleep in the terminal until around 7am the following morning (6/15/15), or pay out of pocket for a hotel room since they were not offering this to passengers. They only reimbursed the ticket fee but then passengers were left to scramble for a place to sleep and alternate route to LA. All in all, choosing to once again fly Spirit because it's a 'cheap' option resulted in us actually spending an extra $210 dollars between a hotel for the night, booking a new ticket home, and cab fares since I could no longer pick him up from the airport (he will land in LA in the middle of a Monday morning).

We tell them that since they took so long, we're worried about making our flight. \u00a0She says you have time to make the flight but you're bags may not make it until the next flight. We were worried we won't make our flight but security only took about 10-15min so we got to the gate 15min prior to our flight AND they did not let us on... AGAIN we got there 15min before takeoff and they wouldn't let us on even though we paid and checked our bags. \u00a0So we then hoped that our bags didn't make it, but NO the bags made it but somehow we didn't AND they won't refund us for anything, they were not helpful in explaining WHY as I still don't have a reason other than the Captain wanted it and a complete LIE about us being called on the speakers which never happened. I understand the airline industry is going through struggles, but this is theft. \u00a0They took our money, did not provide a service to us when we made it there EARLY. \u00a0Then, even after they royally screwed us, they weren't even apologetic or bothered to offer us an explanation. \u00a0They kept repeating the blame on the Pilot and saying that there's nothing they could do and there is no supervisor.No help at all, no accountability at all. No desire to help us out with a rental care that we had to drive at 12am to make it to work on time from Vegas to LA. No refund for the checked bags that they shipped without letting us which contained all of my personal belongings. \u00a0The worst part is that we got the opposite of an apology, we got disrespected.

The price for a United ticket was over $1000 per ticket. The Spirit price (after I joined their $9 ticket club and saved $156) was $500 per ticket. The plane (an Airbus) was new, I upgraded to more legroom for $25 per ticket. The food was cheap, and if you purchase a drink and a snack, the price is cheaper than the items alone. The flight attendants were young and friendly (no so on the last American Airlines flight I took in May - cranky old hags). I also booked a rental car through the airline, and got a mid sized SUV (Nissan Rogue) for $40 for 5 days. That's $8 per day for a car that normally costs $40 per day.

Usually, when visiting the midwest, I fly Delta and have never had any problems. This time, however, I was looking for very specific flight times and, unfortunately, wound up purchasing a ticket from spirit airlines. Not only was it not made clear when I purchased the ticket that my $400 round trip from LAX to Minneapolis had a three hour layover on the return, but when I went online to try to change my flight, the website kept malfunctioning. I ended up calling in to change the flight, which resulted in the fee being raised from $90 to $100. The explanation I got? It's an \"agent transaction fee\". I explained to the woman on the other end of the line (who barely spoke English) that I had attempted to switch my ticket online and I found it preposterous that I should be charged a fee due to something that was their fault. Her response? \"I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.\" So, I ate that charge, paid the ticket difference and continued on my merry way...until the return flight.Now, I would probably be much more livid had the LAX employees not had a \"no care given\" approach to their jobs. Apparently, as I found out at the Minneapolis airport, I was supposed to have paid $65 for my carry on, and they wanted me to pay $100 at the gate for the return. I was NOT having it. I explained that I was not charged for the carry on on the way over, and I should not be charged now, especially on such an empty flight with such ample space. Again, I was met with \"There's nothing I can do.\" They did end up dropping the gate charge to $65 dollars because a fellow LA resident was at the gate complaining about the same issue. Still, when all was said and done, my round trip on this \"discount\" airline cost me $550, which is more than I've EVER paid for a round trip to the midwest, not to mention the fact that these extra costs are a total surprise. What if I hadn't had and extra $100? Would they have made me leave my luggage in Minnesota?

Cost: \u00a0Ticket was cheaper on spirit (39$ vs 79), but I added a checked bag. \u00a0I could have carried it on, but I didn't want to bother with it and since I would have paid for it anyway, I checked it. JetBlue's check in line was ridiculous so I checked in curbside (fee to do). Carry on was an option \u00a0Adding the baggage fees (both airlines had them) and fees to get through to my destination, and the money spent buying food on the plane added in, winner....Spirit- by 23$ *note: JetBlue was late and ended up giving me a credit of 75$ on future flights, however I cannot use that to subtract from this price comparison2. \u00a0check in desk:. \u00a0ZERO, and I mean ZERO lines at spirit. \u00a0because you pay 10$ to check in with a live person, no one was there. I used the kiosk for free and walked by bag up to check it, then I was on my way. JetBlue: I checked in curbside, paid a fee, and beat the line, which was stupid beyond belief. I do believe I could have checked in by kiosk, or phone and carried on my bag and beat that line, but I knew the flight was delayed and would likely be packed so I checked my bag (and it was a good thing I did). Winner: Spirit. 2.5 check-in TSA: \u00a0At that time, Spirit was not part of the TSA pre check program which sucked. \u00a0JetBlue was, and the McCarran airport security queue was at least 1-1.5 hours long. With pre check, it was 10 min, max. JetBlue wins by a longshot in this category, but apparently Spirit is weeks away from joining the pre check program. Winner, JetBlue (soon to be non issue as apparently Spirit is targeting sometime in November, per a Cleveland newspaper article, \u00a0for TSA pre check ability). 3. Boarding: Spirit was faster, mainly because there was less carry on bags. \u00a0Both flights were near capacity, but in the JetBlue plane, everyone had a carryon and the last 10 or so people couldn't find bag space, so they ended up having to check the bags at a delay. \u00a0Winner, Spirit.4. \u00a0In flight food: \u00a0Yeah I got a drink and a snack, which was yummy if memory serves me right, with JetBlue. \u00a0I also got a drink, and a snack, and another drink, on Spirit. \u00a0I paid for them all but I was able to get them whenever I wanted as they weren't serving the entire plane, only those willing to pay. \u00a0so essentially I paid for better service, better selection, and multiple purchases, which Is something I would be willing to do on the ground, so for me it was a no brainer. \u00a0Winner: \u00a0Personal Preference, but cost winner would be JetBlue, unless you are not on a tight budget, then Spirit.5. Airplane comfort: \u00a0Make no mistake, the JetBlue planes are nicer and the free TV options stellar. \u00a0Spirit cannot compete. \u00a0Winner: JetBlue.5.5 On time Performance \u00a0Spirit took off and landed on time. \u00a0JetBlue delayed my flight 6+ hours and I ended up missing 33% of the event I was traveling for. \u00a06. \u00a0Off Boarding. \u00a0No bags. The entire plane emptied out in record pace on spirit. \u00a0JetBlue, took FOREVER to get of the plane as everyone was trying to pull their bags down, then clogged the works up. Winner, Spirit.7. \u00a0 \u00a0Baggage claim: Bag came out quick in both locations, but since an entire plane load of bags on spirit took 4-6 minutes to hit the carousel vs an entire planeload of JetBlue took 10+ minutes, Spirit wins. \u00a0honestly though this isn't a fair comparison. \u00a0McCarran/LAS (Spirit) John Wayne/LGB (JetBlue) are two entirely different airport classes. \u00a0But if one were to compare, the smaller airport should have cleaned the larger ones clock. \u00a0I found that opposite as Spirit soundly defeated JetBlue. \u00a0Many factors can change this, but on this day...Winner...Spirit.General feeling: I enjoyed my Spirit flight better. \u00a0Missed Pre Check availability, missed the advanced entertainment items, but that's it! \u00a0Spirit wins."}, {"count": 1732, "date": "8/4/2018", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Do not, I repeat, do not book a flight with Spirit.

The flights were pretty much on time, the flight crew was friendly, and everything went smoothly. Seats on the plane were low on legroom, but I didn't find it all that bad -- I've been less comfortable on some Southwest flights. My only complaint was with the ground staff at the LAX ticket counter. For some reason, there was no luggage quick drop for prepaid bags, as the website promised (and as they have in Vegas). Everyone waited in one line. There were three agents, and they seemed to move incredibly slowly. Each person they helped took a very long time, and they kept stopping to ask each other questions, tap away at their computer terminals, and have extended conversations with the customers. I don't know what issues they were all working out, but I started getting nervous about being late for my flight! They need to boost their efficiency and have a separate place for people just dropping off their prepaid bags.Three stars overall for a solid, gets-you-there experience.

I was unaware that my company failed to purchase a carry-on bag for my return flight and was informed upon boarding my flight. I was told to visit the customer service counter and speak with someone to purchase a bag because my ticket did not reflect the purchase. After explaining the circumstances to the Spirit Airline Supervisor, I was directed to go back to TSA Check-in to purchase a bag from the kiosk for $50, only 20 minutes before my plane was to depart. After returning to the airport entrance to purchase a bag from the kiosk, it immediately read an error message due to checking in 2 hours prior. The Spirit Airline Supervisor should have known that you cannot check in twice from a kiosk. I had to go back through TSA check-in, only minutes before my plane was ready for departure. As I waited in the TSA line for check-in, the same Spirit Agent called my name several time over the intercom to announce the plane was about to close the doors for departure. I was able to make it back to my boarding gate to explain the situation to the agent before the plane departed. I informed her that I was unable to purchase a cheaper bag from the kiosk and I didn't have enough money to purchase the $100 carry-on bag fee.

I already informed her that I had a funeral to attend and needed to be on the flight to make it in time.Michelle still wouldn't let me board the plane without purchasing a carry-on bag. I asked for her to call the corporate office to see if she could get approval from her management team and she refused. She immediately got on the phone to start a personal phone conversation. I asked for her full name and she refuse to relinquish the information, while maintaining her phone conversation.

We get to the airport at 1pm for our 2:45pm flight home and we're told at the ticket counter that our flight is delayed until 6:45. Dang!! That's a long time, but we already returned our rental car and there's nothing close by the airport so I guess we're waiting at the airport for almost 6 hours...fun!!6:30 comes and a plane from a different airline is at the gate that we were told to go to. So I go wandering around the airport and find the Spirit flight to San Diego at a different gate (no announcement or anything). I walk up to ask them what's happening and we're told that the plane is coming from San Diego and it's in the air on its way to us, but now the departure time is 8:10. Okay...what the hell!?I go back about an hour later to see if they're going to reimburse us at all and there is an angry mob around the gate. Some people are cancelling their flight and getting refunds other people are just trying to figure out if the plane is really coming. Apparently the plane still hadn't actually left San Diego at all. LIARS!!!!Rather than waiting for the mob to clear out, I decided to call customer service. When I called in and asked how Spirit intends to compensate me for my time and money I was told several times by the woman on the phone that the flight was cancelled!! However the ticket counter continued to claim that the flight was already in the air leaving San Diego on their way to us, but now the departure time was 10:15pm!! I asked the woman on the phone 5 times if the flight was cancelled and she even put me on hold to confirm it and she returned to the phone saying yes it is cancelled. I asked to speak with a supervisor several times before she put me on hold for almost 10 minutes while she got a manager. The manager came on the line and said it's not cancelled. WTF!? So 10:15pm was actually the departure time now. \u00a0Granted this was on a Sunday night, so everyone who was supposed to have a connecting flight from San Diego to other places have all missed those connecting flights and will now not be able to go to work on Monday morning.And when I asked customer service if they were going to compensate us in any way, they responded with the option to cancel my flight and get a full refund, but not cover the extra cost to get on a different plane with a different airline, or I could keep my ticket and continue to wait for a flight that I wasn't even sure was actually coming at all and they would compensate me with $50 off of my next flight with Spirit. Which is COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS because I NEVER want fly with Spirit ever again!!To top it all off, they provided food for us because everything in the airport had already closed(which seemed nice at first) but of course no vegetarian options, only burgers.

The flight attendants are SO nice. It kills me that people complain about things that are VERY clearly spelled out on the website. My last trip to CLE in Dec from LAX was $130 RT with a checked bag and the trip I'm on now was $100 RT, just using the free personal item as I don't need winter clothes. Both prices are out the door, including taxes. I also see people complaining about the leg room. I don't get it. I flew united and had WAY less legroom. I actually think spirit offers more leg room than most airlines.Things to do when flying with Spirit:-Only go directly through Spirit's website when booking. I've heard of people having LOTS o problems with other agencies including Kayak and travelzoo. They offer their own best prices anyways. Buy tickets on Tuesdays when they run their promos. Best time to buys is usually 2 Tuesdays before your trip. My last discount was 75% off my ticket - booked 2 Tuesdays before my trip using their promo code. $100 out the door ticket from LAX to CLE with taxes and everything? I'll take it.-Buy your checked or carry on bag when buying the ticket. It's around 40-60 bucks to check or carry on RT but who cares when your trip is $70? Are you really going to complain about a RT ticket that costs you $140? No. If you do, you shouldn't be flying Spirit.-READ EVERYTHING. DO NOT ADD things instantly to the cart. Fully customize your ticket. Pay attention to the step by step process on the website. If you read everything, you'll be fine.-Buy a bottle of water in the airport. They charge for everything on the plane and you can get a bigger bottle for your money in the airport.-Don't pay to reserve a seat. The beautiful thing about Spirit that most people don't even realize is they don't care where you sit. Once they announce boarding has ended you are free to get up and move to whatever seat you want. 3 flights consecutively I have had my own row and slept the entire duration of the flight.-Don't fly spirit for holidays. I personally avoid traveling for holidays at all costs. It's a pain. But, I will say Spirit is more likely to be delayed during holidays because they are a budget airline.HAPPY FLYING!

People say you get what you pay for, but I'd say you get much, much less.I've flown Spirit on 3 separate flights, one one-way and a roundtrip, between LAX and PHX (~1 hr flights). I purchased my tickets online. The website is so awful and literally a waste of time. At each page, something pops up offering some type of \"service\" or \"perk\" that is basically Spirit's way of bleeding your wallet dry. It literally took me 20+ minutes to get through all the pages and actually purchase my ticket. With the ridiculous prices for check-in bags AND carry ons... No thank you. The only reason why I originally purchased my flight, and continued to buy another round trip, with Spirit is simply because I figured a 1 hr flight couldn't be that bad. Next time, I'd much rather pay the extra $$$ to a better ticket with a better airline. Each time I have flown Spirit, they have all been delayed 45+ minutes. Granted, I saw notifications prior to buying my tickets that warned of delays so I can't complain too much. However, each time my flight was delayed I received zero notification until I either pulled up the website or when I go to the airport. The notification system is so spotty. My first flight, I didn't get any notification. The second, I got e-mail notifications as I was sitting at the gate (already aware of the delay). The third, I didn't get notification until 2 days AFTER my flight. \u00a0And then there's the actual flight. I've flown plenty of different airlines to different locations, and Spirit has -- by far -- the slowest and least likable customer service. The seats are uncomfortable and crowded, with absolutely no services on the actual flight. I also don't know what Spirit's deal is, especially at big airports like LAX, but of the two flights that landed in LA, both had us waiting at the tarmac for a half an hour. Out of the airline's control, but still a part of the experience. Just seems like, when you fly Spirit, you're expected to be served last. Overall -- just bad experience after bad experience. I keep thinking that it'll get better next time, but I am convinced that this is just the norm when you fly Spirit. If you are in dire need of saving money, take a chance by flying Spirit.

An hour before the plane was ready to take off, Spirit CANCELLED the flight and provided no sound reason as to why, explained it was a system glitch, and that it was not their fault. Instead, the best they could do was offer to reschedule the flight, the next available flight was one week later, the photographer was scheduled to shoot the next day, so that was not an option. We panicked and were working on a way to get the photographer to location since the shoot was the next day. Unfortunately the photographer missed the photoshoot because we did not have the budget to purchase a new ticket the same day, ticket prices for same day flight had tripled in costs. When I called Spirit to get a refund, the Spirit rep said records show that the passenger was a \"no show\"....even though I had proof, an email notification that said the flight had been CANCELLED (1 HOUR BEFORE TAKE OFF). They went on to explain that the only way we could get reimbursed is if we physically went to the Spirit service desk at the airport so they can issue a ticket refund.

Ismael explained the priceline thing to me as well.The plane smelled bad. It was awful. It started around rows 19 & 20. A rancid stench of rotten Lindberger cheese. It didn't ever go away. On the flight was lots of turbulence. I would have reached for the barf bag, but it was buried under old trash, dirty diapers and chewed gum...well maybe not the diaper part.The stewie even got on the intercom and suggested that passengers with alcoholic beverages better \"down em\" quick.

I assumed I could get sleep with that extra leg room. I'm 6' 3\" and 190 lbs: tall, thin, with long legs. \u00a0 \u00a0 Although I didn't see it when I purchased the tickets, I learned that Spirit seats seem to be about 2 or 3 inches narrower at the shoulders & seat base than other airlines. Even if Spirit did state the width of their seats I never thought to measure the seat widths during the dozens of other flights I've taken on other airlines. \u00a0Spirit should warn you at the beginning of the seat purchase process, \"Our seats are extremely narrow to the point that anyone that is average height or taller will find their shoulders hitting those of passengers in adjoining seats, and their elbows will be in their neighbor's ribs or lap. Be prepared to turn your body at an angle for the duration of your flight in order to not impede on the space of your neighbors. Thank you for your willingness to torture your back for hours at a time so that we may carry more passengers in ever smaller spaces. Mahalo.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Spirit's seats also do NOT recline: not 1 degree! After the painful & uncomfortable 4 hour flight, I went to Spirit's homepage & read their \"logic\" for not making reclining seats. They admit that stationary seats are lighter and don't break so they save $ millions on fuel & repairs, but they also claim it's to prevent customers squabbling over the seat backs impeding their space. I think any infrequent disputes would be solved by better designed seats; providing more space between rows so you can stand up without hitting your groin against the seat in front.  \u00a0 \u00a0 1 year ago I had rotator-cuff surgery, but I completed physical therapy so my shoulder is fine. But, it hurt on this flight because I had to turn my back so that my shoulders and elbows didn't bump into and over persons seated to my left and right. The elbow rest pressed hard in to me; this hurt my shoulder & my lower back and made for no sleep. \u00a0 \u00a0 The \"Big Seats\" in the first few rows are suppose to be equal width & leg-room to first class on other airlines. Days before my return, I bought adjoining Big Seats 2A & 2C (my daughter was flying too) & got a reservation confirmation. I could have bought 1A and 1C, but feared they were too close to the bathroom. \u00a0 \u00a0 At my electronic seat confirmation and check in, about 12 hrs before my flight, I confirmed my seat numbers & printed my pass. Spirit was also silent when I checked a bag two hrs before boarding. \u00a0 \u00a0 On board, I learned seats 2A & 2C were now separated by seat 2B; as narrow as the regular seats on the 1st flight; no extra leg-room. \u00a0The only Big Seats on this plane were in row 1 in front of me, and those seats were already filled. \u00a0The stewardess guessed they changed from the plane I saw on Spirit's website during my upgrade. She took my info. & and said she would see about a refund for the Big Seats. \u00a0During the 5 hr flight Spirit didn't apologize, offer a discount or even a free drink or snack for its mistake. So, for a 2nd cross country flight, I sat in an uncomfortable middle seat, had to twist my back and shoulders at an angle, and my shoulder and back got sore again. \u00a0 \u00a0 The kicker was that this seat was so thin & without any hard structure that every time (every 5 minutes or less, including the 1/2 hr at boarding) the passenger behind me put stuff in to the seat back area, I could feel her fingers & hands moving up & down against my back. 45 minutes into the fight, I asked the college student behind me to stop constantly going into the seat-back because I could feel every probe through the thin seat material. \u00a0 \u00a0Spirit has refunded my Big Seat upgrade, but it hasn't refunded any part of the cost of my regular ticket. I contacted its Customer Support, and they falsely claim they are addressing my concerns, notifying different departments, improving its service, blah, blah, blah. \u00a0They have, in 4 different email responses, ignored my repeated request for a refund on a portion of my regular ticket cost for Spirit's failure to notify me of the plane change, failure to give me an opportunity to choose a different seat, failure to warn at the time of purchase of the possibility of not receiving the actual seat I was upgrading to, failure to provide a modicum of customer service during the flight and complaint process."}, {"count": 2121, "date": "5/7/2016", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Worse airline to fly with!

Oh and I should mention... this was our HONEYMOON!! \u00a0 To kick things off our flight from LAX to FT. Lauderdale was delayed by almost 3 hours. Fortunately we had a 9 hour layover which meant that the delay did not interfere with our connection, however still a first letdown. Spirit Airlines was able compensate us for the delay by giving us each a $50 voucher, only good for flights... oh and it expires in 30 days, way to go Spirit!!Anyway we made it to Jamaica and had the time of our lives for the next week.... This would all come to a screeching halt when the time came to journey home. \u00a0Here the story gets a little long so try to keep with me. We were delayed yet again, not surprising, from Montego Bay back to Ft. Lauderdale. This connection was a very critical one because we had only an hour and a half before our flight to LAX started boarding. The hour delay caused our plane to arrive late to Ft. Lauderdale and this prevented us from getting through customs. In fact customs was so backed up that we had to sit on the plane at the gate for almost 45 minutes. All we could do was watch the clock and think that we would not be able to make our connection. Our hunch was right, by the time we got through customs our plane was announcing that the doors would be closing momentarily. Regardless we still sprinted through the airport to try to recheck our bags. At the baggage recheck there was not a single assistant present to help get our luggage rechecked. So we ran upstairs to ticketing. The not so friendly ticketing agent reluctantly took our baggage and muttered to us that neither us nor our bags would be making the flight. We were still determined to try, so we left our bags and tried to rush through security... Speed up a bit... We got to the gate just in time to watch our plane taxi away from us. Now the fun really began, we went to a customer service agent from Spirit who was overly aggressive and said \" You have to go back to ticketing!, I can't do S#!T for you\". Alright so we go back to ticketing and request to speak with a manager who was also in a fabulous mood and said that she would not speak to us unless we waited in another very long line. At this point I was beyond frustrated and decided to just speak to a normal ticketing agent. This woman was clearly not happy to be talking to me as well, but she did manage to get us on the next flight to LAX the following morning. There was only one extra stop that we had to make in Atlanta first. The airline just shooed us away with no compensation for any inconvenience, no recommendations for a nearby hotel, oh and guess what... our luggage did make the flight to LAX, so we had NOTHING but the clothes on our back for the next day. The hotel we ended up in was a nearby Ramada Inn, which was a complete dump with cockroaches running across the floor.... They will be my next Yelp Review Victims. The next day flight went smooth but again we had a very tight connection which sent us running through one of the biggest airports in the Unites States. All in all I will NEVER be recommending Spirit airlines to anyone, and they could not even pay me to travel with them again.

We almost instantly started declining, my girlfriend looked out the window and said she seen smoke and started crying. Meanwhile we continued a downward decent but we landed semi-smooth and came to a stop, fire trucks started surrounding the plane and we sat there taxing for 20 minutes in suspense and panic. Finally the captain said we would be towed in shortly. We sat there for another 30 minutes in more panic thinking the plane was going to catch on fire than he said we would turn on the engine not on fire and go to the terminal on our own. Finally we starting moving and went to the terminal where they told us they will have another plane coming from Dallas and will be here shortly within a couple hours. Two hours past and they said they are still working on a plane from Dallas. (still working?) Than they said they found a plane in Vegas but it has to be cleaned and they have to find a crew.

NOBODY wanted to help us, nobody would open the door, people were extremely rude, waving us off even though they had nobody else to help.

Missed our flight, got rudely yelled at for 30 minutes, they won't even check the cameras to see that we were telling the truth and there on time.

It's an economy airline and if you keep this in mind, you won't be disappointed.Spirit delivers exactly what they promise: inexpensive flights with no extras. If you're looking for a luxury experience, you're probably best looking elsewhere. \u00a0Ticket prices are SUPER cheap (my one-way from Cleveland to Los Angeles was $53) because they supposedly pack more people on the plane, making things \"cozy\", and lowering the price for all. They are up front about this and clearly state on their website that they will charge you extra for literally everything else. Not sure where all of the confusion and griping in many online reviews comes from because this is true and nobody lied about anything. Think of it as buying air fare a la carte and do the math before you buy. I'll acknowledge that charging for carry ons is atypical and I don't know how much that costs because I only brought my purse on the plane with me and there was no charge for that. \u00a0Checked bags cost $30 each which is comparable to other airlines. Don't try to get around this though because an oversized carry on that would have cost $30 to check at the ticket counter will cost $100 to check at the gate. Bring your own snacks and drinks or buy them on board. I didn't buy anything because the menu looked mostly like vending machine fare. Prices started around $3 and items could be purchased in bundles to save a few bucks. There is no wifi or tv/movie service (complimentary or for purchase) so bring a book, download something to watch on your tablet or take a nap until you get where you're going. Now, about \"cozy\". This was initially so concerning to me that I likely wouldn't have given Spirit a chance if I had any other options. Thing is, there were no other flights from Cleveland to Los Angeles that fit my schedule when my I had a last minute change of plans so I bit the bullet and braced myself to find out what cozy meant. It turned out that \"cozy\" was not a euphemism for \"tiny\" as it is when real estate agents use the term. The standard seat was the same as those on other major airlines I've flown that cost more than twice as much. I elected to pay $12 for a seat with extra leg room and probably would have been fine without it, but somewhere over say, Colorado, I was glad I splurged. I'm 5'4 so I imagine men and taller women would find this add-on to be money particularly well spent. \u00a0The flight attendants were polite, the plane was clean and baggage claim went smoothly without any snags. \u00a0My total cost was just under $110 for a last minute nonstop flight from Cleveland to Los Angeles with one checked suitcase, the seat with extra leg room and various airport fees/taxes. Compare this to my original ticket with American Airline that was $223 (not including their $25 checked bag fee), purchased months in advance and included a layover in Chicago.

At every moment they are trying to hustle you.A glass of water?\"Everything is for purchase,\" said the saleslady ($3!)The fare I booked six weeks ahead was about what I normally pay, \u00a0with cheaptickets or priceline. I fly to NY (from LA) at least twice a year, and usually pay between $200 -$300, round trip. Never more. Often, I get direct flights.Spirit offered $249. Not bad. I did not visit their website.

I waited until the night before, which is what you have to do with other airlines. Spirit knows that once people hear about the fees at the airport, they will take out their iphones and go to the website to avoid paying the scammers. So, they prevent that within 24 hours of your flight!\"It's all there on the website,\" said the weary lady at the counter. A weak defense. Caveat Emptor. Let the buyer beware. You know who uses that? Con men. Scam artists. Hustlers. People who know that what they are doing is dishonest.A the gate, I complained to the guy. Same numb. Same script.\"That's how we offer low fares.\"Except they are not low, once the damages are added up. They are actually higher than competing fares.

Purchase anything? Purchase anything?\" The hawker repeated in a cold metallic voice, as she made her way down the aisle. Both return flights were delayed.

I think Spirit is marvelous if you're: a) traveling alone, b) pack light, and c) have a short flight.This airline preys on the stupidity of people. Yes, that's a bit harsh but Spirit makes money from those who don't read or research fees. People who think that they can have the same benefits for less costs. After you've had a reality check, you realize that there are ways to beat the system! Do yourself a favor and be a smart traveler by being informed. Do your due diligence and read up on the fees. Yes, there are extra fees for bags, selecting seats, printing boarding passes, and onboard refreshments. The business model takes \"no frills\" to a new level. Those that don't give a crap about where they sit, know how to pack efficiently, and don't have to fly long distances will be just fine. I believe people feel unnecessarily cheated because they're not being charged a one-time transaction. Even if your flight was $30 and your carry-on was $35, that's still cheaper than the vast majority of tickets from other airlines that don't charge for carry-ons. It's just a different pricing model. Let's say you were charged $30 for a flight, $35 for carry-on, $3 for a drink, and $10 for printing a boarding pass at the airport...even that is still not as bad as some people are making it out to be. Ask yourself...are all the little charges still cheaper than the cost of a ticket on a different airline? Don't get hung up on being charged what you think is unwarranted. Base your assessment on the total cost. \u00a0Now if you're complaining about being charged $100 for a carry-on when you get to the gate, that's on you. If you want the deal, then do your homework. If you think your bag is too big, then measure it or...wait for it...pack a smaller bag! If you're about paying minimal fees, don't be ignorant and give them a reason to charge you. \u00a0Remember when food was free on airlines and then they took it away? You lived. Flying Spirit? You'll live. \u00a0My dad had suggested taking a bus when airline prices went up. When I told him and my sister I was flying Spirit, they were horrified. My sister sent me info on Spirit and my dad said he would pray for me. Needless to say, I was apprehensive about taking this airline because of the negative perception...but I'm really glad I did. Plus, I'm all about beating the system (so that I could be posting a stellar 5-star review and not be a 1-star victim). I took Spirit from LA to Vegas. It's about an hour so no big deal. I purchased my ticket less than a week in advance. I didn't mind being a middler/backseater for an hour so I didn't select my seat. I also had my boarding pass printed ahead of time. I should mention I'm short (5'2\") so legroom is never an issue for me. However, I thought the legroom was normal based on the people sitting next to me...so I'm assuming that a lot of Yelpers complaining about the legroom are tall. I also packed 2 going out outfits, PJ's, heels, and minimal toiletries within the dimensions of a personal item per Spirit guidelines (16\"x14\"x12\"). Oh...and my flight was full so I guess they must be doing something right. I found the customer service great. The people at check-in and the gate were cordial and helpful. The pilot cracked jokes and the flight attendants did the same. They really livened up the mood and also gave a personalized shout out to someone who was celebrating a birthday (Happy birthday, Jorge!). We took off on time and ::drumroll please:: we landed early. Yes, you read that right. 15 minutes early. \u00a0 Don't hate on an airline that offers super low fares without the bells and whistles. Spirit does not claim to be anything else besides being the cheapest. In the end, I felt like I was on Southwest but paid way less. That's exactly what Spirit is trying to be. When we landed, the pilot actually stated that they are the only ultra-low cost airline in the industry. For a $30 flight when everyone is charging way more? You better believe it.

After flying Spirit numerous times with no issues, and even recommending to all my friends, I will NEVER fly Spirit again. I will pay the extra money to fly a legitimate airline who actually cares about their customers. Spirit says they're just A to B... that's funny because they don't even get you A to B! They just cancel your flight and take your money. I was notified just hours before my flight of a cancellation due to weather. There was NO inclimate weather, and all other airlines still flew to our destination. It seems as though this is usual for your airline to cancel flights last minute for NO reason. Furthermore, after sitting on the phone for over an hour and demanding to speak to a manager (or anybody who knew what they were talking about because you couldn't even UNDERSTAND the representative on the phone) I was offered NO SOLUTIONS. This is absolutely inexcusable!! The only offer Spirit airlines made to fix this issue, was to fly me out an entire week later. How pathetic. Our hotel and all activities for Jamaica were booked and paid for. Even offering to fly me out a week later is a slap in the face. An airline should do everything in their power to accommodate guests on the NEXT flight to their destination, and in some case, even pay to put them on a different airline. Not Spirit. The incompetent \"manager\" on the phone couldn't even give me sure answers to the questions I was asking. After having to come out of pocket and book Jet Blue flights (much better airline, highly reccomend) we still made it to Jamaica with no help from Spirit. Now on our way home, first things first I opted for my boarding pass to be emailed so I wouldn't have to pay to check in. You guessed it- Spirit never emailed the boarding pass. Upon arrival to the airport, I waited 10 minutes to use a Kiosk to print my boarding pass (2nd attempt now) and was greeted with an ERROR message and was told to see an attendant. Then we stood in line for 40 minutes (3rd attempt for a boarding pass) to speak with an attendant. This ended up being an 1 hour process to get boarding passes which is just ridiculous. Finally, as we're boarding for our flight from Jamaica to Fort Lauderdale, I'm notified that our connector flight from FLL to BWI is now delayed. It's just disheartening to know that this airline not only doesn't care about their customers, but also uses sneaky ways to fill planes then cancel flights.

It was only a 2 min difference! Mind you the plane has not even started boarding. I don't understand why they wouldn't let anyone get a boarding pass when it's only a couple mins past the 45 min check-in. Then when I asked to change my flight to the next day, they said they couldn't change my flight on the computer, that I would need to call customer service. BUT aren't they customer service? They were answering really rude too. I don't appreciate their attitude.When I called customer service on the phone, they said I would have to pay a total of $163 if I change flights because there's a change flight fee of $100! I only paid $60 for my original flight, & when I checked online, the flight for the next day was still $60. They wouldn't do a price match to the online price. What a rip off. When I flew Southwest, I can change the flights anytime with no charge & only pay if there's a price difference.

This is a seriously sneaky and misleading business model.To make matters worse, I sustained a serious injury which required surgery just a week or so before we were to travel. There was no way I'd make it on a plane so we had no choice but to cancel our trip.

He received an automatic notification stating \u00a0\"As we are a \"web driven\" company, we are more than happy to assist you through email correspondence.\" And that they would not be able to work with him over the phone.

Another words, they hook you in with low cost airline fairs but then nickle and dime you on everything else. Yup. That's right. $30.00 to check a bag, $3.00 for a 6 oz. bottle of water, etc. The reason Spirit is always delayed is because they don't have enough planes to service their markets. So if a plane has a mechanical problem anywhere in the country you are screwed Jack..Here's my best advise. Avoid these Monkey Bastards like the Plague.

I love their value but it seems the old adage you get what you pay for and this is no exception. In early November, I took a red eye from LAX to Detroit. Everyone and anyone who's flown with Spirit knows about the nickel dime part, so I get that. What was weird was I paid for the round trip which presumably includes a chair so my ass can sit somewhere for four and a half hours, but when I went to pick a seat, what had been free earlier now was $18 or so dollars. \u00a0So I pick a seat in the rear next to the window. Leaving LA that night some seats were empty. I could see a couple had left a seat in between themselves open, and the husband had taken my window seat. \u00a0The plane had fully boarded and they were closing the door. \u00a0Treated like a child. \u00a0I wanted to take an empty seat so a couple could sit in the same row with a seat in between. \u00a0\"No, no no!\" \u00a0The cabin crew insisted I take the seat that was on my boarding pass. Now hold up. \u00a0I used to fly for United Airlines for almost 10 years. An empty seat once the aircraft door is closed is considered fair game...are they going to auction off the seat during the flight? \u00a0This has happened a few times flying with Spirit...and I've been overseas this year so it's not like I don't have a few miles under my belt. \u00a0So I took my assigned seat, and the couple had to sit shoulder to shoulder with me (I'm about 210 lbs. with broad shoulders). I bought a drink as I intended to rest during the flight. Even though the tray table was angled down a bit, I thought I would make the most of it. I was coming down with what felt like a cold and was looking forward to drifting off.....but as I relaxed my drink slid down the tray and right into my lap! \u00a0I thought that maybe I had balanced the drink and spilled it as my arm rested, so I bought another one....started drifting again...same thing, second drink fell into my lap. So I got the flight attendants to come over and see the tray table was broken...rest? \u00a0Turns out it wasn't going to happen. \u00a0The flight attendants move me to the seat that I was going to take in the first place! \u00a0See it doesn't make any difference? But guess what, I buy a drink, drift off to sleep....and bam, the drink winds up in my LAP AGAIN! \u00a0The crew gave me a few drinks, but any rest on the red eye was vanishing as the flight went on. I mean, come on! \u00a0A broken tray table is a broken tray table. \u00a0Why would the crew make me sit in a seat with a broken tray table. I did mention I flew for several years, if the crew was on a turn, they HAD TO know about it...but didn't care. On the way back to LA a few days later the experience was different. I purchased a larger seat in front (1A). \u00a0Different experience altogether....and considering my experience outbound, a completely different experience going back to LA. \u00a0Spirit most definitely is a great deal, but you are getting what you are paying for and in the end with all the nickel and diming....the hassle of the broken tray table, the indifference and patronization (\"Take your assigned seat\") by the crew, I am thinking of switching to Delta. \u00a0I paid the extra money for just about everything for Spirit and in doing so, realized I could just pay extra up front and fly with Delta next time. \u00a0I'll do that next time.....since I can afford to. Spirit may think the bottom feeders are stuck, but through their cheapness they are losing a higher yield passenger (I bought all the extras), to another airline. \u00a0I decided this after my third drink had spilled onto my lap because of broken tray table #2 and I was standing in the aisle because my pants were wet. Have to find that picture of me in the bathroom trying to dry out my crotch area because it looked/felt like I had peed my pants. \u00a0I had to laugh so I wouldn't take it out on the overworked crew....because if this is how a paying passenger is treated...

Sadly, I'm not kidding.YOU GET THE PICTURE. Note, this information is NOT available when you purchase through a third party site, and only obtainable on the spirit airlines site unless you dig deep.Do the math, if you're a party of two on a round trip, you can count on adding $150 to the cost of your tickets if you check one bag each.

Our flight time back home was about 25 minutes apart. He told me on the phone that Spirit would not check him in because they have an one hour rule for check ins. We checked in around 6:05pm and his flight was at like 6:50pm.So what does Spirit Airlines do for him? Nothing. Absolutely nada. Not even an attempt to find another flight or accommodate him in any way. Just a, \"Sorry sucker, thanks for your money. NEXT!\"As I'm on the phone with him, the Jet Blue counter guy shook his head and explained to me that every airline has different check in minimum time and pretty much saying that Spirit can suck a nut. We called my buddy over and though he had to buy a new ticket, it was for sure not going to be with Spirit. I told him, I'd write a lovely review for him.Jet Blue even moved my seat and our other buddy's seat to sit next to my poor friend up in the front, row 1 (which is the more spacious leg room seats).

Another lady that was on my flight complained that they did not allow her to carry her carry-on luggage on the plane forcing her to pay the $52 for two bags. Then to top it all off going to my destination I was delighted to see that the plane had mist on either side of the plan to keep the plane cool. But on the way back there was no mist furthermore it was down right hot and stuffy in the cabin. Then the flight attendant had the nerve to get on the P.A system and announce that several passengers were complaining about it being hot but if you turn on your air above your seat it will cool the plane down. I have never heard of the extra air that is provided being used to cool down a whole plane. WOW!!!Oh and last but not least nothing is free. You are charged for everything right down to a soda and please don't think you get any snacks (i.e. pretzels or peanuts), you'll pay for that too.

Because you're not flying Spirit Airlines!Y'know what? \u00a0That wasn't fair. \u00a0I was plenty comfortable on my flight, but only because I got incredibly lucky and found an old lady who either didn't or pretended not to speak English in my seat and I ended up picking a row that remained empty. \u00a0So I got to lay down and sleep, and enjoyed a cup o noodles in the sky (you can buy those on Spirit Flights. \u00a0It ALMOST warranted a 2 star review).This actually speaks to a greater point, and is the main reason you should really take this review to heart: my actual experience was totally okay. I'll explain how this is possible as we move forward, but you should know that this review isn't being written by someone who's angry that he suffered. I was fine. But NOT because Spirit Airlines is competent, I just happened to luck into fineness IN SPITE of Spirit's best efforts to ruin my good mood.I have so much to say, I'm not the totally sure where to begin... How about the moronic website? \u00a0It's yellow. \u00a0Like Canary yellow. \u00a0In a font that makes Comic Sans look like a fine choice for a term paper or published eulogy. \u00a0And the loading page says \"now preparing something awesome\" which is the first clue that whatever is being prepared will be anything but. On that website they ask you to pay for lots of stuff, like your carry-on bag. \u00a0And they don't ask for, y'know, just a little bit more than the NOTHING other airlines ask for. \u00a0They ask for 36 bucks. \u00a0Which is a lot. \u00a0But it's not nearly as much as the ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS they charge you at the gate if you do what I did and say you don't have any bags, hoping that your carry-on will qualify as a \"personal item,\" which is free but infuriatingly amorphous in the sense that the site offers no readily identifiable indication as to EXACTLY what size is allowed. \u00a0Oh, and I found out about the hundred dollar thing after I'd already checked in and did a Google search. \u00a0Spirit didn't offer a good natured if overly-colloquial prompt like \"Are ya sure, guy? \u00a0It wouldn't be awesome if you had to pay the one hundred dollar bag fee at the gate!\" Nope nothing like that. And there's no way to amend your check in to include a checked bag once you've gone through the process. \u00a0So if you optimistically believed you could pack light and squeeze everything into a \"personal item\" sized bag, but then couldn't, you'd be sh*t outta luck if you wanted to add a bag and pay the (not nominal, but nominal-er than a hundred f**king bucks) fee.But I'm lucky, I never had to pay that fee... Because my flight was delayed 6 hours! \u00a0So, by the time I got to the airport (I checked the status before driving to LAX and was thusly spared having to endure this delay at the airport, which, believe it or not, was held against me by a Spirit employee when I was inquiring about a rebate -- but more on that later), nobody had time to measure my bag amid the throngs justly angerfied passengers.So I didn't pay a thing.Then the flight happened, and that was fine, with the sleeping and the steamy hot cup o' noodles.THEN when I disembarked, I made my way to the ticketing kiosk to ask Spirit to, at minimum, help facilitate a cab to my nearby hotel (I had a ride arranged but that was, y'know, six hours earlier). \u00a0I was initially brushed off by a nice enough lady who asked her not-nearly-nice-enough superior what, if anything, Spirit was doing to compensate travelers for the six hour delay -- a delay caused, to the best of my knowledge, by an understaffed plane at the Dallas Fort-Worth airport. \u00a0After a dismissive head-shake from the supervising agent I was told \"sorry\" and asked to leave. \u00a0So I did, but while making my way through MSP's maze of tunnels to try to find a hotel shuttle it occurred to me that I actually had NOTHING BETTER TO DO than go back to the ticketing kiosk and ruin everyone's morning. \u00a0So that's what I did!And by then at least one other traveler had congregated to complain alongside me, and with numbers on our side we got our just deserts!Except that no, we didn't. \u00a0We were told en masse to f*ck off, lied to about a fifty dollar credit that has yet to appear in my account (which we have to use on a Spirit Flight within 60 days -- HA!), and, like I said earlier, I was actually admonished for spending the delay in the comfort of my own home instead of the airport terminal. \u00a0\"How come you didn't talk to someone at LAX?\" \u00a0I was asked. \u00a0\"Because by when I got there, 40 people were in line to talk to someone at LAX ahead of me, then the plane took off.\" \"Oh, so you didn't even have to wait at the airport?\" \u00a0Like I'm the as*hole.Boo, Spirit."}, {"count": 2579, "date": "5/5/2017", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Literally if I could give them 0 stars, I would.

Maybe that's my own fault for not being more thorough. On my way back to LA, my flight was delayed from 8:45 to 9:45, then 10:45. Weather and FAA furloughs were to blame, so I suppose I'm being harsh.

They should charge one fee round trip if they base on itinerary or correct baggage fees per fight, otherwise their fee's are falsely advertised!!!!Cant wait for that lawsuit! I just read spirit is one of the fastest growing airlines in america, and their over-inflated hidden fees are the reason. We booked through an agency or \"on-line\" agency and after returning home they charged us 40$ just for booking with an agency, no notice, nothing just charged for not booking direct! They charge if you try to pick a seat, though according to the spirit reps they don't even offer that service on Vegas flights, so they will charge you for a service that can not be provided! The airplanes themselves are pretty bad. Old, smell and the seats are tiny.

If you are taller than, 5'5 I suppose, then you may be a bit uncomfortable.My whole experience with Spirit would have been perfect IF the flight on the way home hadn't been delayed over an hour. They said it was a crew issue (bc there was no bad weather) I was in no rush, but still, if I had to catch a second flight or something, I would have been pissed. So just keep that in mind when planning your trips, it could be risky. But if you're going to Vegas, just make sure your return date is cleared so you don't have to worry about being late for something.So keep in mind, for a low cost trip (especially to Las Vegas), If you can survive an hour sitting in close spaces, and If you read all the rules and stuff, I definitely recommend Spirit.

Spirit Airlines is so cheap that they have 5 employees working multiple positions at LAX AIRPORT meaning the same employees that check your luggage in are the same people that will board your flight so I strongly suggest you arrive early.

Saw a guy paying $100 cause he didn't buy it before- The leg space is less, the seats don't recline (doesn't affect me as I'm 5feet 6, and Im working on my Mac for 4 hours on the flight so dont need any form of reclined seats)- Payment on flight is only by Credit card, which works for me, as I travel cashlessI hope this helps the community, will update this after flying for a few more weekends.

I went for it. Big mistake!Worst experience ever! I purchased an extra ticket for my dogs and still had to pay an extra fee $45 for each carrier. I had 2. The carriers are considered \"personal items\" so no checking in a purse! I had to check my carry on for $50. The male flight attendant was so rude. Didn't even greet me at the entrance and didn't offer any help with my dog carriers. He told me I would be sitting at the end of the airplane, which my tickets had a different seat closer to the front. One of my dogs was very nervous and was having an anxiety attack. I opened the dog carrier to rub his head and make him feel better, but the male flight attendant came to my seat and told me my dog couldn't be sticking his head out of the carrier. I tried to explain to him why I had to do that, but he refused to listen. At that point the plane was already moving and was going to take off. The flight attendant was very condescending and asked me \"are we going to have to go back to the terminal?\" As if I was a child! My dog started barking uncontrollably. I tried to explain to the flight attendant that my dog was just nervous and he would be ok in a moment but he ignored me and got on his radio with the captain and told him we needed to go back to the terminal. They told me I had to get out of the plane. I got out and they had the airline security outside waiting for me as if I had done something wrong.

This time I took a short trip from Houston to Los Angeles and thought I should give spirit airlines a shot since it's much cheaper, oh boy I was wrong - the worst nightmare in my whole life has just begun.First off, they charge you $10 to check in at the airport counter. In order to avoid this charge you would have to check in online and print out the boarding pass. I was fine with that and things went well at the Houston airport. I did not bring extra baggage because I saw on their website that they charge you $31 (one way) for a carry on baggage. You're only allowed a personal item without paying extra. And if you didn't pay that extra baggage ahead of time, they would charge you $100 at the gate. Thanks god I read that before I departed. They charge you extra for selecting seats too. Just any seat. I have never experienced this with United or American Airline. I guess you get what you paid for. Of course we did not pay that extra charge so when we were boarding we were assigned the second last row on the plane. It was a 3 hour flight but it felt like forever - keep in mind that I travel internationally frequently and my flights are often 12+ hours - when I was on the spirit airplane there were a lot of Mexican families with 5 or 6 babies who literally cried and screamed through the whole flight. I had to put my headphones on because I just could not take it anymore. The cabin interior was old and dirty, there were trash everywhere and the toilets were dirty as hell. I'm very skinny but I barely fit my legs between the seats. You can tell that a lot of the passengers who fly with Spirit are lower income families. They have bad manners and do not control their kids. Spirit Airline also charges for EVERYTHING. I was trying to get a cup of water and was charged $3. Ridiculous.If you think that was it then you are wrong. The real nightmare began when we tried to check in for our return flight at LAX. Our flight was 3:46 pm and we arrived at the check in counter at 3:11pm, meaning we were 35 mins early before the flight was supposed to depart. I was only told that we needed to be at the gate 15 mins before the flight, so I thought we were on time. Oh god...I cannot tell you how angry I am right now. I'm writing this review as I'm waiting for my flight with United Airline. YES, United Airline. Because I was told that we were \"too late\". The spirit agent showed us a sign at the check in counter saying passengers need to be 45 mins early before the flight departs. I WAS NEVER INFORMED ABOUT THAT RULE. Not when I booked the flight or on any of the text messages I got about the flight status. I'm a very time-sensitive person and if I was ever told that we needed to be at the airport by X time, I would of course be there by that time. So the agent told us that we could not get on that flight and they would have to reschedule us for the next available flight, which is 2 days later!!! Like what the hell???? No refund either because it's only valid until 24 hours before the flight departure time. I asked him why I didn't see anything about the 45 minutes rule when I booked the flight, he said it's because I booked through Orbitz. Then he opened the spirit website and showed me about the 45 minutes rule under \"legal documents\", which is in the smallest possible font at the very bottom of their website, consisting of 10+ pages. I was absolutely stunned - they expect customers to actually find those legal terms on their website before everyone books a flight?? It's like whenever you sign up for something, are you supposed to read through all the terms and conditions line by line?? Especially for this kind of things, they should be made very clear to every customer at the time of reservation. I literally started crying because I have to be back in Houston for my final exam tomorrow. But the agent at the spirit counter just did not care. Their attitude was rude and unprofessional. They just said we should have read those legal documents and it's not their responsibility that we were gonna miss our flight. I just find it extremely unseasonable - I was there 35 mins early and surely had more than enough time to go through security and get to the gate, especially with no checked bags. They just did not even let me check in \u00a0and would rather spend 30 mins arguing with me than letting us just go to the gate already. In the end we had to get tickets from United Airline which cost us nearly an extra $1200 (single way) which arrives the next morning. But that was the only way for us to get home on time for work and school.

Probably burned out from all the complaints.- Dirty planes- Atrocious customer service- BBB score = FThe problem is that it is extortion. When one buys a ticket through an aggregate service like Priceline or Kayak, he/she shops for the best deal. When a ticket says a price, the consumer needs to be notified of any hidden fees that may balloon the total cost. The email confirmation from the aggregate does not mention the hidden fees for a carry on. It's not until you are able to check in 24 hours before your flight that you are notified that, oh, its extra for a carry-on. Guess when the cut-off is to cancel your flight for a refund? If you show up to the airport without paying the $35 fee(one way,+$70 for round trip), then its +$50 at the check in counter. If you show up to the gate with a bag, then its +$100 one way (that's +$200 for round trippers! - just for a carry on). If you don't have the money to pay for your bag, then you are sentenced to airport purgatory until you pay up and they will keep all your money, no refund if you cant shell out the extra $100. That is extortion. The problem is that if one is shopping for the bus, but gets charged for the limo then they feel ripped-off, which is what this airline does. It misrepresents its final cost and blindsides with hidden fees that cost way more. The gate keepers are worn out and not friendly because everybody is complaining to them about the same problem.

I decided to do some research about the airline and find out just what all of this awfulness was about so I could be as prepared as possible in advance. This helped immensely.Here's the good and the bad of Spirit Airlines.The Bad1) There are extra unexpected fees for things that most other airlines include in the price of the ticket such as your seat reservation and carry-on luggage. I didn't know about these fees in advance of booking my ticket, which made me feel like I was duped into buying a seemingly \"inexpensive\" ticket. After the fees, the ticket is practically the same price as any other airline. I had to pay extra to reserve my seat ($25 each way) and for my luggage ($30 each way). That's a total $110 extra. Had I known about these fees before I bought my \"cheap\" ticket, I would not have booked this airline.2) The airline is completely disorganized and the people who work for it don't seem to really want to be there. When we were at the airport waiting for our flight, our gate had changed at some point and we weren't alerted. We asked a Spirit employee at another gate and he became agitated and could not answer our question. We roamed around until we found the right gate that was labeled as Virgin America. There wasn't a sign anywhere for Spirit, we just happened to find a herd of people waiting to get on a plane and that was our Spirit gate. After waiting for a short while, they got us all on the plane, in a disorderly fashion. No line. The herd just moved onto the plane like cattle. Fine. We got on the plane.3) After getting to my window seat, I realized none of the window seats have armrests! I thought it was just mine but I looked around. I suppose this is one other way to save some money. It wasn't a huge deal, but I found this to be a little janky.4) The seats don't recline at all. Very strange, but there you have it.The Good1) Overall it may be cheaper to fly this airline if you don't care where you sit and you don't need to check luggage or carry on a piece of luggage bigger than a backpack. A small carry-on is free. You do have to pay for a large carry on.2) One bonus is that you can pay as little as five dollars extra for an exit row seat. You have to go online before your flight to pay to reserve a seat. I highly recommend this. For $25 per seat we got the exit row and a ton of extra leg room. More than I've had on any other airline.3) My plane was actually pretty new and clean. I was pleasantly surprised by this. I had heard they use old planes, they are \"gross,\" etc, but I think the smaller planes are newer and tend to be cleaner.Would I use Spirit Airlines again? Probably not. I tend to pack a lot of stuff, so flying without checking luggage or taking a large carry-on is not really an option. I also like to sit with the person I travel with, so I will not be wanting to pay extra fees to do that either. I also prefer as little stress as possibly when flying, so I'll pay extra if I think another airline can do better customer service.

Semi- hidden charges for nearly EVERYTHING. \u00a0I say semi because if you read the \u00a0fine print you can see SOME of fees that are tacked on. I have flown many times, so I assumed a lot of things about this airline and was wrong. \u00a0You're charged for carry-ons, drinks, bags over 40 lbs, checking in at the gate instead of online. Fortunately I read a lot of what the fees were so I knew most of what to expect and A friend of mine also warned me so I was not too shocked. However I still do not like it. To have ticket prices advertised so low and then 80% of what I need for the flight cost more means no my flight was NOT as cost effective as I thought. I would have booked elsewhere. \u00a0After booking I had questions and the phone number only gives a recording which is maddening. I needed HELP and there was no one to assist me via phone.On a plus side the staff in LAX was great very friendly and understood that a lot of people would be PISSED about all of the fees. THERE FORE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS GREAT!The flight crew and captain were hilarious. Check in was easy! I just knew it would be the same experience in Minnesota! However, \u00a0In MSP BOOOOOOOO The line to check in was totally unorganized. One lady asked if we had already checked in online we said yes she ushers us to her to get the bag checked THEN turns to another family that she had not finished helping. I do not believe the lady was trying to be rude she just busy and trying to do too much at one time. \u00a0 We stood near a kiosk waiting to be helped a good 7 or 8 minutes my husband finally just started on the kiosk on his own assuming that is what we were to do (because no one said anything to us and there were 6 open kiosks). We almost finished but had a question to ask the lady who was still helping the other family (we did not want to get charged for using the kiosk when we already checked in at home.) when a different lady asked if we already checked in online and had the tickets printed. My husband told her we checked on and had the tickets on our I-pad. \u00a0The lady rudely remarks and sort of rolls her eyes \"You have to print off your boarding pass\" and Taps the kiosk THAT WE HAD JUST FRIGGIN USED AND HAD A QUESTION ABOUT. Okay \u00a0our mistake for not printing the passes before we arrived, but the eye rolling was unnecessary. \u00a0There was a different lady in training who was very friendly and a little nervous when she had to tell us to pay $25 more for our bag. I imagine she gets yelled at A LOT for the fees! \u00a0But hey it's not her fault! Then we are about to board the plane and the disgruntled worker who is let us on the plane REALLY IRRITATED ME She seemed very disinterested but ok \u00a0I guess we can't smile ALL the time. I said thank you she handed me back the ticket and she actually sighed mumbled \"Yeah Ok.\" \u00a0My mind shouts-HUH??? WHAT WHAT HE HECK?? Is \"you're welcome\" no longer an acceptable response to \"thank you\" did I miss the memo!? \u00a0Theeen there is a disturbance on the plane and we cannot finish boarding. we are standing in the taxi (I think that'st what it is called) for a good 10 minutes NO Explaination. 1 worker rushes to the plane and says excuse me to the passengers as she passes by and between people which is cool. But later the same RUDE ticket girl squeezes hey way by, no excuse me, no pardon me old lady for nearly knocking you over as I bombarded my way past you NOTHING. \u00a0We were finally told the situation when another passenger stopped a worker leaving the plane to ask what was happening. Nothing serious but its bogus he had to ask for answers. not knowing made us more nervous. For being a newer airline Spirit has some OLD PLANES! Many seats had rips in them and were worn through. My tray table on the LAX-MSP flight was dirty. and My husband is 5'10/5'11 and as he got off the plane he said \"Please let's never fly spirit again My knees are sore, the seats were so cramped.\" This man does NOT complain about discomfort unless it is bad. Quick reviewCon- Things normally included in ticket prices are NOT with Spirit that's why the BASE PRICE is so cheap. prepaid luggage ranges from $21-150 depending on price. and if ya dont prepay all luggage carryon included is $100! Water and soda $3 coffee tea $2 My flight that I thought would be $244 ended up $549.96 after picking my seat, bag & fees overage fees, (bag was 50 lbs their standard weight is 40)Pro- I had no flight issues 1st flight was only 30 min late no biggie LAX cust service was great!If y you need an all/ mostly inclusive airline I would NOT recommend Spirit. \u00a0 If you want to save money or need a cheap last minute flight and do not have luggage, or care where you sit and do not mind eating and drinking before getting on the flight,(water is not free) then you may like Spirit"}, {"count": 2930, "date": "8/27/2015", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "DONT DO IT!!!

Bags can cost you anywhere from $26-100. If you buy your bags online at booking, it's $26. I believe carry-ons are $36. If you buy it after booking, the prices goes up from there. 2) Nothing on the plane is free--not even water. And free snacks? ...forget it! There is also no entertainment whatsoever. So bring a good book or take a nap. 3) Spirit planes have been known to depart up to 30 mins earlier than the flight departure time on your ticket. I don't know how or why corporate allows this. But it happens. So get there early. If you get to the gate on time, you might miss your flight. Delayed flights are also very common on Spirt. Consider yourself lucky if your flight is on-time. 4) Their frequent flyer program that they try to push on you is totally useless--so stay away. I've already taken about a dozen flights with Spirit over the last 2 years, domestic and international, and I've earned about 13,000 miles. It sounds like a lot. But in reality, that 13,000 miles is only equivalent to about $10 off your next flight. It cost $60 a year to be a frequent flyer member and use your reward points. It's not worth it. 5) The planes are ok, but the customer service is awful. Hopefully your flight experience goes smoothly. If you have problem and need to talk to customer service, then good luck. They're reluctant to help, and sometimes they charge you a $10 fee per call. They openly admit that their cheap fares is an excuse to deliver below average customer service. Despite all the negatives, I've saved thousands of dollars flying with Spirit. I've taken flights from LA to D.C. for $46 round trip. LA to Miami for $74 round trip. Many of their flight prices are unbeatable. You will save money, but just be aware of how the airline operates (tips 1-5) so you won't encounter any surprises during your flight experience. They'll get you to your destination, but you can forget about being pampered. Good luck!"}, {"count": 2963, "date": "8/29/2015", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "SCAM ALERT!!!!!!!!

Spirit is getting the classic internet pile-on treatment, IMHO, so I thought I'd share a positive experience. \u00a0I do not mean to discredit those who have had legitimate poor service, rather offer up another perspective that is positive. Here are some common complaints and my experiences regarding them: -Carry on fees. \u00a0 I paid nothing. \u00a0 I had a duffel bag roughly 2 feet wide and 16 inches deep, and it fit well within the 'free carry on' bin. \u00a0I used this bag to travel around Europe for 3 weeks. \u00a0Not only this, but when I went to check the bag, the counter rep made sure that I tried to fit it into the measuring bin first so that I didn't have to pay. \u00a0 Also, there are terminals that let you print your own boarding pass out so that you don't have to pay the $5. \u00a0There was a rep walking around shouting this out so people were aware of this - they look like mini-ATMs-Late/cancelled flightsMy flight to Vegas had me on the ground 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. \u00a0Flights get delayed, however the reviews here make it sound like every flight will be late. \u00a0My return trip was on time as well. -No free drinksBottled water and soda costs the airline money, and I think it is rather asinine for people to expect them to give them away for free. \u00a0Other airlines do, however you are going to pay more up front for your ticket. \u00a0If paying $3 for a bottle of water gets your panties in a bunch, then you probably shouldn't be going on vacation until you can save up a little more cash. \u00a0(sorry, had to editorialize a little there)-Tiny seats/no leg room I am 6'2'' 220 lbs and I had PLENTY of room - my knees were nowhere near touching the seat in front of me. \u00a0Granted, I paid the extra $10 to get within the first 10 rows. \u00a0Perhaps the rows in the back are more cramped, however I didn't have a chance to look. \u00a0Pony up $10 and you'll be fine. \u00a0-Old/crusty airplanes. I have no complaints here. \u00a0The seats were a little worn, however they weren't filthy by any stretch of the imagination. \u00a0Even if there were crumbs, I'd rather deal with it than wait an extra 30 minutes for the staff to clean the cabin top to bottom after every passenger switch. \u00a0-Unsafe planeOne commenter here noted \"fly at your own risk\", which had me wondering if I was going to see duct tape on the wing. \u00a0Both trips were among the smoothest flights and landings I've ever experienced. \u00a0-Rude staff. \u00a0I didn't encounter this at all, not to say that they don't exist. \u00a0The initial check-in lady actually saved me $30. \u00a0The flight attendants were neither rude nor exceptionally nice, but I'm not there to socialize. \u00a0 \u00a0Maybe I got lucky, I don't know, but I've had far worse experiences elsewhere. \u00a0 I believe we're in the age of entitlement and everyone expects things to go their way all the time. \u00a0Youtube Louis CK's \"Everythings amazing and nobody's happy\" for an idea of what I mean. \u00a0 \u00a0I would most definitely fly Spirit again, but then again I don't expect people to give me free stuff wherever I go."}, {"count": 3015, "date": "8/22/2016", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "It's a budget airline people.

I live in LA and the chances of getting a good price and flight time without missing too much work was slim to none but I tried anyway. I work in the travel industry- for a cruise company's air department so I have a lot of knowledge of the airline industry and fares, etc. I did some searching around and found a Spirit Airlines flight roundtrip from LAS to ORD for $138. The times looked good, the fare was amazing, the next lowest fare I could find was on United for $600. How could I NOT take this Spirit Airlines flight??I, an avid Yelp-er, read HORROR stories about Spirit and really hesitated about buying my non-refundable ticket. But, my motto for 2012 is You Only Live Once.. and I was definitely up for an adventure so I took a chance and bought my ticket. Now, the only problem was getting to/from LAS from LAX. I spent almost as much on my flight from LAX-LAS roundtrip as I did from LAS-ORD roundtrip. I expected the worst for this flight to ORD but it was only a 3 1/2 hour flight so how bad could it be?On my connection from LAX to LAS, I planned a 4 hour layover so I could get a little buzz on while I prepared myself to take this horrible flight as all Yelpers have talked about. My flight was at 1:30am from LAS and arrived in ORD at 7:00am. When I got my boarding pass 24 hours in advance, I did not want to pay extra to select my seat but I also have to fly sitting in a window seat so I knew this would be tough when the auto-system assigned me a middle seat. GREAT. Well, I lucked out- the window seat ended up being empty so I was able to slide over and sleep the whole way to Chicago. The leg room was super tight, I'm only 5'2'' and I get RLS on flights so it was pretty rough tying to keep still without bumping the seat in front of me. The service on board was bare minimum but the plane was clean and the actual seats were just like any other seat I've sat in. Since it was a red-eye flight, the cabin was dark and everyone was sleeping anyway so who cares if they didn't serve drinks.My flight home was awesome- I did not want it to end! I had a 10:30pm flight from ORD back to LAS. Again, I didn't want to pay extra for a seat but the auto-system gave me an aisle seat. When I arrived at my gate, I asked the gate agent if there was by chance any window seats open. There was an emergency exit window seat open... score! The legroom was out of this world. I was practically smiling the whole flight home just because of all the space I had to stretch out.The only reason why I gave Spirit a 4 out of 5 is because I still think this fucked up that they charge for carry on bags. I paid ahead of time because I didn't want to be surprised at check in and really be screwed with fees. I paid $30 each way, but still even with the bag fees and the fare, it was still the cheapest way to get to Chicago. I just read a news article that says that come September, Spirit's fares will drop but their baggage fees can exceed up to $100 for carry on bags! Not sure how I feel about this one. But, if you can hang with carrying on a bag that fits under your seat, I guess it's worth it.I would fly Spirit again because my experience was great and not what everyone here on Yelp described.

He was decent, except he told me the only way to correct all of this was to cancel the entire reservation (not just the fee they added without my consent), and that it would take 20 days to get a refund since I used a debit card. Insane. I have contacted my bank and they advised me to have the company fax the Debit Card Fraud Dept, so I can get my refund in a timely manner. And if they dont? I will file a claim.

I was so unhappy with my experience that it lead me to leave my FIRST online review ever. I fly at least once a month and the flight was HANDS DOWN the least pleasant flight i have EVER been on. Understanding that Spirt is a low cost airline i figured why not save a few bucks... what a terrible decision. Not only did I need to pay for my carry on but i also had to pay for my seat... What is the point of buying my ticket if i had to also pay for a seat. Well i decided to splurge and spend an additional $18 on a seat in row four... As someone who is 6'5 i really messed up that decision. There was basically no leg room. I measured with my hand and was able to touch not only my seat but the seat in front of me with a single hand (appox. 8 inches of leg room)... where are my legs suppose to go? So should i have sat indian style? Stuck my legs in the aisle? Put my feet on the seat in the fetal position? I only wish i could attached pictures to this review to accurately depict the struggle.Simply the seats were so small that i did not fit. I was forced to put my legs in \u00a0and out of the aisle for the entire 4 hour flight (that left at 7am, when all i wanted to do was sleep)Cool the base price of my ticket was something like $170 dollars but with the $45 dollars for a checked bag and $18 dollars for a seat on the plane plus cost of a soda i ended up not saving any money and had a miserable flight. Flight crew/ gate employees were friendly enough but it felt as if they needed to spend the entire flight dealing with unhappy customers. NOTE: If you do not check in online early... it is $10 dollars to do it at the gate. If you do not pay for your bags early it is ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS yes $100 to check your first bag. Most airlines charge extra for oversized bags starting at 50lbs... not Spirit, it will be an extra $25 if your bag is between 40lb and 50lbs and $50 if it is over 50lbs. I will NEVER fly Spirt Airlines again. I dont care if they gave me free flights for the rest of my life, the amount of discomfort i felt on the plane is not worth it. To summarize. I was nickle and dimed with every aspect of the flight just to be put in a chair that was made for children.

These idiots at Spirit on both occasions have us land in a completely different terminal than our connecting flight so we are forced to go through this ridiculous TSA BS again!

Well, airline fuel plummeted also... where did that money in savings for fuel go? Right to shareholders, instead of their customers. I'll tell you why they are most profitable airline... Because they advertise a lower fare and then charge you for EVERYTHING possible. Oh you want to pick your seat so you can sit next to your wife?... that's $30 each way for each passenger. You want to check a bag? $45 minimum each way. Oh you a little thirsty are you? Would you like a refreshing coke to wash down your Xanax? That's another $3 per coke. Wanna cookie? Another fee. Don't have time to print your boarding passes? Well, Spirit apparently still lives in an age when they cannot scan a boarding pass from your phone. So, printing that boarding pass is gonna cost you, like $10 per ticket. Wanna carry on bag to stow overhead, NOPE! Gotta pay for that too!Every leg of our trip (4 legs) our seats would NOT recline and what did the flight attendant say when I told her this? \"It's probably you guys\" meaning my wife and I had bad luck.

He had his Luggage Resolution Agent Tiffany write to say \"I am unable honor a refund of your air fare as you successfully completed the travel associated with your reservation.\" Here's what Baldanza calls successful travel.12/16/2013 Dear Mr. Baldanza:We were on our return trip from Dallas Fort Worth to Los Angeles with ourtwo children. We drove to the airport and checked in with plenty of time tospare for our 6:00 AM flight, which was due to arrive at 7:22 AM.We checked two bags and the car seats for our two children, ages five andtwo. We were careful to follow all instructions regarding checking in ourcar seats. Our flight arrived at LAX on time, but our two car seats, did not. As car seats are required by law for children under the age of eight who travel by car in the State ofCalifornia, pursuant to California Vehicle Code \u00a7 27360 (a), we werestranded at the airport without said seats. We immediately informed yourrepresentative in charge of baggage about our missing car seats. We weresent to the ticket desk and back down to baggage again. Eventually we weretold that our car seats had been sent to Las Vegas and would not arriveuntil 3:00 PM. After that we were told that the seats would not arriveuntil 5:00--then not until 5:30.We asked the sole representative who stood in the baggage claim kiosk if hehad any replacement seats we could borrow for our two-year-old boy and ourfive-year old girl. He gave us two booster seats. We explained that atwo-year old cannot ride in a booster seat. He took the second booster.Half an hour passed. He returned and gave us an infant car seat. Weinformed him that a two-year-old is not an infant and an infant car seatwould also be unsafe for our two-year-old. He said that those were the onlycar seats they had, urging us to take them. It was clear to us that boosterseats and infant seats were the only car seats that were ever stocked, aswhen we asked what people with children between the ages of twelve monthsand four years did when their car seats were lost, we were told that thatthe stranded person was expected to send out a friend to buy a car seat ather own expense and bring it to the person who was stranded at the airportwith his children. Given that the loss car seats clearly does occur, to noteven stock appropriate car seats for a whole age range of children isentirely reprehensible on the part of your airline.Meanwhile, our daughter came down with the stomach flu from which ourtwo-year old son had just recovered. She was suffering from diarrhea andstomach cramps so bad that she was screaming in the bathroom. Of course, wecouldn't take her temperature at the airport, but when we got her home wemeasured it as 102\u00b0.Our pleas for help fell on deaf ears. When we said we had no one who couldgo out and buy us a car seat, your staff told us that they had no employeesto spare to go out and buy us the appropriately sized car seat.At no time were we offered meal vouchers or even a place for our family towait. Only through our insistence were we issued meal vouchers. However,for our potential ten-hour wait, we were given vouchers in the amount of$7.00 per person. At airport prices, that is the equivalent of a soft drinkand a bag of chips each. Furthermore, even finding a place to sit proveddifficult. As the majority of the restaurants in our terminal were behindsecurity, we were advised to walk to the international terminal, butwhen we got there, we found their main restaurant section closed forrenovation.Given no other option, one of us (Robert) traveled to the distant, offairport campus lot at which our car was parked due to the Thanksgivingdearth of parking. We wish to note that the staff of Spirit Airlines didnot so much as offer Robert a ride to our car. The other of us (Nicole)stayed with our sick and crying children while Robert went to a Target located ten miles away to purchase a $140 car seat. It was 3:00 PM before we were able to reunite our family and leave the airport. Robert missed a day's work.Our car seats were not returned to us until after three 3:00 PM on December3, 2013, approximately thirty-two (32) hours after our flight arrived.Finally, we wish to add that we are outraged by the behavior ofyour employee who suggested that we use either a booster seat or an infantcar seat for our two-year-old child because they were the only seats hehad. Using either a booster seat or an infant car seat for our two-year-oldson would have placed us squarely in violation of California Vehicle Code \u00a727360 (a), [a copy of CVC \u00a7 27360 is enclosed].

Anyone rating this 5 stars *cough, below me* has never experienced the joy of walking 3,000 miles with their luggage dragging dutifully behind them. At least you'd feel as sense of satisfaction upon arrival.I had never flown, or really heard much of spirit before this trip, nor had I intended to take it. I was matched with it due to a reservation issue, however I thought , \"eh, how bad can it be?\" And the price at first did seem quite reasonable.I'm the first to say, I understand their business model. As far as I can tell, their target market are those copious traveler's who prefer to travel with no bags, purchase all of their attire, clothing, etc while at their destination, and happily tosh it into the garbage bin on their way back to board this wreck of an airline. Now that may be fine for short trips, but for most people, not so much. And setting the baggage weight limit 10 lbs lower than the standard is a very nice touch.I will say that for the price I paid after all of the fees, it was much more expensive than it would have been to take a better airline. If you are going to charge for every thing aside from the dubiously filtered air, at least run as efficiently as you run your accounting book. And I simply don't care how much they post their fees on their website..charging for baggage going on a connected flight is simply stupid. \"Oh no, miss, why on earth would I want my luggage to go on the connecting flight, and arrive at my destination with me, when it enjoys my layover city so much better, I most certainly won't be needing to pay that fee.\"So, much to my astonishment, when I arrived at the airport, having prepaid the fees, having my carry-on already said paid, I'd found out that the person I SPOKE TO ON THE PHONE to make sure everything was in order, somehow had me departing with no carry-on, but had me with a carry-on from my connecting flight for returning but not my returning first flight either. Stop..think about that. I'm traveling with a bag mid trip without having ever brought an initial bag on board. I can think of various lines of \"work\" where something like that would be desired, not many legit areas, however.Once that was sorted out, and the higher fee paid since it was the day of the flight, I proceeded to a part of LAX I did not know existed. As my walk continued, the crowd thinned out, and I started to ask myself \"hmm, why are people avoiding walking this direction?\" I vaguely recalled a review on here mentioning a construction site being similar to the departure gate.Upon finally finding the gate..it took all of my willpower not immediately march right back to another terminal and beg for another premium flight that offered more assurance that it would in fact be able to get airborne. That terminal looked more like a war bunker (and NOT the side that's winning). It honestly felt like a refugee camp. \"Surely an airplane doesn't depart from this...\"gate?\"\"..Then the panic set in, and I went to the nearest bar to try to relieve some fast mounting anxiety. It was then that I met you dear yelpers. I'll admit the posts made me have a mild panic attack. How could I have been so careless as to not read reviews about this airline.I did see one silver lining, however grim, at least these reviewers lived to write their posts, as bleak as they may be.So eventually we boarded to plane (after changing the gate 3 times in 15 minutes). \"Hmm..so this is what plane hell looks like.\" As I made my way through the tiny aisle toward my tiny seat (Which did not come as a shock based on reviews), I observed the surroundings. The plane was foreboding. \"Wasn't this in Final Destination?\"). The seats were tattered, the carpet was dirty, and I'd made up my mind that I would NOT be going to restroom no matter what happened.As I sat down in my seat, banging my knees on the back of the chair, I looked around and thought \"just please let this sucker fly\" as I tried to banish what seemed to be a high likelihood that'd we'd be more likely to drive this plane to Ft. Lauderdale, before the air agreed to sully itself by lifting it up to soar.When we finally took off, I was thankfully buzzed enough from the pre-game at the bar, to pass out. I figured if I died, Id rather not be awake for it. We did eventually make it to Ft. Lauderdale, and for what its worth, but ride wasn't too bad. I left the plane, merely thankful that we'd arrived alive, grateful that the spirit didn't leave my body.\"It wasn't that bad\" I thought \"eff that, yes it was..this was terrible and I cant believe I was charged this much for this crap\", while vowing never ever ever again to book another flight on this airline from hell.See Part two for the return flight...it get's worse."}, {"count": 3164, "date": "10/13/2016", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "we booked our trip through cheap tickets.com and ended up with Spirit due to the timing of the flight. upon arrival at the automated kiosk there was an additional charge to carry on luggage.

When we approached the counter to verify this was in fact a charge the employee simply wasn't having anything to do with us. Rolling her eyes repeating several times with out making eye contact \" that's our policy\" \"that's our policy\" She didn't seem interested in apologizing for the matter or attempting to provide some type of service other then lip service that was seemingly out of sheer irritation. Quite possibly she is the wrong employee to be at the counter handling customer service matters. More than 5 minutes but less then 10 were spent in an attempt to have a Supervisor come over, but this same employee was not going to budge or provide any type of normal human interaction. We went back to the kiosk to pay for the carry on luggage and print out our boarding passes. To my fault, I wasn't familiar with how Spirit operates so I approached the counter (different counter) to ask if we still needed to check in, even though we had our boarding passes. Mind you we still had the fresh irritation from the previous interaction. This employee seemed already annoyed by our asking a question. Pointed to the line and before I could complete the question stated \"you have to get in line yes behind that guy because he was here first\" he was pointing to the 1 other person in line. So I proceeded to get in the 1 person line at which point the 1 person was at the counter already so I ended up walking back to the same employee. He saw that we had our boarding passes and stated with a tone and attitude similar to my 7 year old when he hears something he doesn't want to hear \"you don't need to check in if you have your boarding pass\" to which I said laughing \"I just asked you that exact thing a second ago\" This employee said why is that funny, you just don't need to check in. On to the plane itself, Rinky Dink plane to say the least. All sorts of noises, creeks and winding noises. The rear mounted table tray on the back of my seat when not in the upright position could be felt through my seat in into my back. Passengers were being shuffled through out the cabin. It seemed like a cargo service that was new to dealing with human beings. Needless to say we took off ok, flew ok and landed ok.

I fly to 8 different cities on an average month, and end up using just about every airlines there is. I'm used to delayed flights, long lines, problems with baggage, and even a rude useless incompetent staff. The bigger the airport, the more standard these are. I can take it. I get that with air travel in coach is the insistence that every one of the passengers is chattel worth only slightly more than a flight attendant's own sense of self worth. I understand that's just how airlines work. It takes a real special airlines to push to lower the bar even further, and I'm amazed in just how many ways Spirit Airlines is able to accomplish that.I'll start with the good, because they deserve that much. They regularly are $40 to $60 cheaper than any of the competition. To be honest, that's a serious edge and for some, notable enough that nothing else I'll say will matter. If you're an unfortunate soul who for some unexplainable reason decided to buy a Spirit ticket without the heavy discount, whoa to you. You messed up.The bad started with the discovery of Carry-On-Luggage-fees. If you have a carry on that can't fit below you in the seats it's an extra $40 each way. If you book it online it's $30. If you're a member of they're $9 Fly Club (Notably $59 to become a member) it's $5 cheaper. You can only book online 24 to 1 hour before the flight meaning if you're on your iphone last minute rushing through the airport, don't think for a second you can cheat the system. When I tried to book online, the system got overloaded once after I finished putting it on my credit card, another time before I could enter in my name, and once before I even loaded the site. I needed to spend a half hour online before completing the savings of $10 (in the end for a checked bag, which meant a further delay later on as that saved me $2 more.) At the airport there were only 6 customers in front of me checking in their luggage, but due to the fact that each one needed to call for the manager, furious about the hidden fees they hadn't seen, it took 20 minutes before I got to the front. With 30 people in front of me at the gate check it took another half hour before I got through the metal detectors.The seats on the plane had a variety of fees ranging from $11 to $50 extra to pick your own. Otherwise they were willing to hand you a middle seat behind the jets and between two fat people. About an hour into the flight I asked for a cup of water. \"We only have bottles. That will be $3,\" the flight attendant said. \"Are you serious? I just want \u00a0a cup of water.\" \"We have a variety of drinks on sale - Pepsi, Coke, Sprite, Water, Orange Juice, Tomato Juice even that you can purchase for $3.\"I stared at her. I did not swear. I just stared as I shook my head.

I only flew with them as last resort to Las Vegas a couple times and I will never again go near this airline. Let's start from the beginning: I honestly do not feel safe in their airplane. Yes, planes have turbulence and they shake but this is on another level for me. They charge for suitcase and carry on bags. I mean I guess that's what you get for paying under $100 for a flight. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THEM IS THE FOLLOWING:Their customer service/support is beyond horrible and disgusting. My cousin was going to catch a flight back home to Vegas from LAX at 3:30 and she got the the Spirit desk 30 minutes before her flight. We understand the the \"rule\" is that a person should be there 45 minutes(all other airlines are 30 minutes) and that the person should be at the gate 20 minutes prior to take off. Now here's where the problems start. We would have been at the desk 50 minutes before if it wasn't for the accident right In front of the spirit terminal. The people at the desk can CLEARLY see from the windows a big bus and car accident with cops around. My cousin didn't have any bags to check, she was wearing flip flops and holding a purse. All she had to do was get her ticket, go up the escalator, and go to her gate. But they said she's no longer allowed to be on the flight because she was 10 minutes late. Again we understand the rule is 45 minutes but she was one person and she had 30 minutes until she had to be at the gate (10 more than the rule). We asked to speak to the supervisor, and they said that the supervisor would get there at 3:45. I'm sorry, why are these people left unsupervised?? Before the supervisor came there was an elderly couple in their early 70s and an older gentleman in a wheelchair getting their tickets to board their flight. They sized their carry on bag to see if it would fit in the bin for the flight and the wheel was less than a centimeter over the the line and they were going to make them pay $50 because of that. Are you serious!?!?! I told the couple to slant the suitcase a little in the bin and it perfectly fine. The desk people were already sick of us at that point but we weren't leaving until we spoke to a supervisor. At 4 o'clock (30 minutes after the flight left and 15 minutes after they told us she would get there-talk about a person who can't time well) dear old Jessica Rodas walked up towards us. First of all, she needs a new job if she thinks this is how she should deal with unhappy customers.She walked up asked us what's wrong and us being already fed up for waiting that long told her what happened in a little attitude. Once we were done she immediately replied back in the WORST attitude and raised voice possible. She had already missed her flight and now we had to deal with this!?!? They called cops towards us and when they pulled us aside we explained the situation to them too and they even said wow they could have been understanding. All we wanted was to be on another flight to Las Vegas the following day at the 3:30 but before Jessica came they told us they'll refund the money with out giving other options. When she said they can't even change our flight because we got our refund back we told her we never got any of that information and we'll gladly give the money back to get the other flight. She then said it was too late. And then with attitude they said we shouldn't have even gotten our refund back and that was a courtesy they did for us. Seriously??? She then told us were no longer customers for Spirit Airlines, but don't worry Jessica we will NEVER be coming back. Nor will be recommending this airline to anyone. As frequent traveler around the world never have I EVER experienced such horrible service in my life. If anyone is looking for a quick flight I highly suggest you go for SouthWest or JetBlue. You will have the best customer service, and friendliest people that will help you. Yes the tickets are way more expensive but in the outcome you get a more enjoyable flight.

Secondly, I was on the phone with customer service (which btw took forever to get someone on the other end. Automatic recording after automatic recording) but she was no help. She had told me that our option was either to get booked on a 6 am flight (original flight was for 430pm, next flight was 6pm but she swore to her deathbed that this flight was completely booked) or receive a voucher. I wasn't too keen on the idea of my girlfriend staying overnight at LAX so I asked if at the very least they can hook it up with a hotel for the night. Ya know, taking care of your customers means repeat customers! They haven't caught on to that though. Customer service agent on the phone said we were eligible for a hotel booking but service agent at the front desk said they dont do that anymore for anyone under any circumstance. Sigh. Huge lapse in simple operational procedures. I knew that no flight on Spirit airlines was ever gonna be fully booked. But, again, customer service agent (on the phone and at front desk) both swore the next flight was booked. After many attempts at telling these people that I KNOW these flights are never fully booked the front desk agent gave my girlfriend a stand by pass for the only flight available that day.

So why the 3 stars? \u00a0Well because it's \"OK\". \u00a0I thought ahead and understood this wasn't going to be like the other airlines, so my initial experience didn't sway more in the negative or positive. \u00a0As mentioned, they got me to where I needed to go, but even though the flights were \"okay\", you will probably experience a negative environment (especially around the gate). \u00a0I witnessed a lot of passengers complaining and throwing a fit by the fees and flight statuses. \u00a0With the hostile passengers made the staff somewhat exhausted and fed up - not many smiles around. \u00a0Besides that, my first flight to Vegas was almost canceled. \u00a0I heard the original pilot \u00a0couldn't make it, but another pilot flew in from Vegas to save the trip. \u00a0It was a 90 minute delay and the staff were fairly convinced I would make my transfer. \u00a0They were right, but the moment I got off the first flight I had to rush to the next gate as they began boarding. \u00a0The airline is marketed towards people that don't want to pay more for the bigger names in the airline industry, but with the extra charges/fees, the flights can sometimes add up to the cost to the likes of Delta, United, Virgin, etc. Perhaps if I continued to fly Spirit Airlines I would run into more obstacles?"}, {"count": 3286, "date": "1/29/2016", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "An hour delayed WTH?!

It was constant chaos with personnel randomly stopping people getting on the plane to examine their bags as an extra \"security check.\" Forget about that getting some overhead bin space!The plane: D-I-R-T-Y, yes, with capital letters and pauses. It was simply disgusting and I have never experienced anything like it. We got to our seats and the magazine pockets in front of us were falling off, so they leaned on top of our knees. Keep in mind, I'm a petite 5'2 and my husband is about 5'8 and we felt completely crammed. How do normal sized people feel? One seriously wonders if we will make it to our destination in one piece. The Service: Talk about nickle and diming you.

A quick Google search told me to have VERY LOW expectations + a high tolerance for this low-cost carrier on my journey from LAX to ORD + back with a stopover at LAS both ways... but even then, 2 stars is the max I would give for the experience no matter how cheap the airfare was.As someone who regularly uses Southwest, which has been compared to a cattle call, my standards of flying really aren't that high to begin with. The most notable but superficial downgrades of using Spirit I could deal with... the lack of TV programming due to the complete lack of screens to begin with, the lack of radio programming available, lack of reading material other than the safety pamphlet, the complete lack of any complimentary snack or beverage service, cramped leg-room between seats, the gates being at the absolute furthest locations from the baggage claim possible... whatever. I expected this + came with my own munchies + entertainment. And then the penny-pinching tactics... charging $30 to carry on any bag larger than a backpack, charging $28 to check-in a bag, + charging $5 minimum to pre-select a particular seat... I expected this as well. To those who didn't know how truly low-cost (aka bare bones) Spirit is, though, I can totally see why this business has an overall average of 1 star from 90+ reviews. \u00a0 \u00a0What I didn't expect despite all my research, though, was how incredibly hard the ancient seats began to feel after about a couple hours of sitting, the lack of toilet seat covers in the bathrooms, + then experiencing the worst turbulence + landing I've ever been through in my entire life. \u00a0-_____- \"\"\" \u00a0Now the reason why I have decided to give Spirit 2 stars rather than 1 is due to inconsistency. My 2 flights from LAX to LAS + then LAS to ORD were without a hitch. \u00a0I checked-in at the counter early enough to get a window seat near the front, the staff were all friendly enough, the flight was on time, + it was a smooth ride eastward bound. However it \u00a0was my return flights back where we began to have issues... First, the first flight was delayed an hour + the only explanation they kept giving us was that they were \"waiting for the flight crew\" ... um, why were we waiting? Were they taking a lunch break that couldn't have been scheduled another time? Were they in transit from another flight that was delayed? Were they just on another flight to begin with + there was a miscommunication in planning??? Who knows. But this delay then made our flight from ORD to LAS become the aforementioned most turbulent flight with the worst landing ever. It was soooo rough that immediately after arriving at the gate, a few people around me rushed to the plane's bathrooms + even, I was feeling motion sick. But there was barely time to recover as we were rushed off the plane + onto the connecting flight that had already boarded its other passengers. That didn't stop a few more people from hogging up the bathrooms on this next plane, though, which then caused us to take off delayed yet again... Lovely. Thankfully this last leg of the trip was uneventful albeit very uncomfortable as I was stuck all the way in the 2nd to last row this time around amongst many other fellow disgruntled or borderline sick passengers.

I asked him why was he behaving so unprofessional when I hadn't yelled at him or blamed him. No response. This is when he figured out another less obvious way to be unhelpful to me. He gave me a number to call for further assistance and he then closed the counter. The counter at LAX closes from midnight until 3:30 am and I had a 11:40pm flight to Houston.Once speaking with the agents on the phone I was told I was shown as a no show so my entire round-trip ticket along with baggage fees was forfeited and that it was the agents job at the counter to assist me with a credit voucher for a future flight. \u00a0There was a chance I could regain my return seat. There was no one at the counter at that time.....I suppose he closed shop and went on break or home. I then had to purchase a flight at another airline for departure. I was told by Spirit on the phone that I would still be able to keep my return flight if I speak with someone later that day. So I didn't purchase a return flight. Later I was told that my return flight was not saved. I then purchased another return flight with Spirit. Once, I was returning back to LA I was told there were 2 seats in my name on the same flight.

Just to clarify... one of the planes 2 engine would not START. There was no reassurance that this was normal, nothing to worry about, etc. It was not cool. - NO LEG ROOM AT ALL. It felt like a bus in rural Africa... my knees were pressing into the metal bar at the top of the seat pocket in front of me and the guy's knees behind me were pressing into my back. - They did not inform me when I booked the cheap ass ticket, but if you want to take ANY bags on the plane, as a carry on, larger than a purse, you have to pay $45. - Absolutely NO frills, no courtesies, no comforts... I do not know how they will stay aloft.I could say more about my experience... like the crying couple behind me, or the guy who got so sick we all had to stay in our seats once we arrived so that the paramedics could come in and help him... but I will just leave you with the cold hard worn out vinyl and ugly blue carpeting facts."}, {"count": 3418, "date": "6/16/2017", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "I have never had a worse experience with an airline.

After hemming and hawing for almost an hour, telling him I had been charged for all my bags, he tells me there is no record of my charge. Funny, seeing as how I have a bank statement that tells me otherwise. After being put on hold multiple times, I'm fed up and just ask him to charge my card an extra 50 dollars on top of the extra money I've already paid.

I understand that it's a business, but their bag fees are double what other airlines charge, they are always delayed, and the staff are not helpful. Every time I have flown, the plane has been delayed by a minimum of 3 hours, and they don't partner with any other airlines so your just stuck and unable to schedule another flight.

The only thing I asked for was water, and they refused to give it to me the first time because all I had was cash and no card (which I think is illegal. I'm pretty sure they are required to give water free of charge). Finally I walked up to one of the stewards, and he gave me hot water from the coffee machine with a few ice cubes that melted instantly. It was still hot when I drank it and they wouldn't give me any more ice.Once we got off the plane, the baggage claim was backed up (the flight from denver before us was waiting over a hour for their bags to get off the plane), so we just waited for our bags as well.

She had absolutely no right to stop either of us from leaving Mexico, especially my wife who was without question able to travel as a US CITIZEN WITH A US PASSPORT. Norma and Spirit Airlines staff offered ABSOLUTELY NO HELP - we only received shrugs from Norma in response, just like a 10 year old. This is a supervisor?? Yes, we caused a scene at the airport out of unbelievable frustration and other airlines offered to help, notably Delta, who kept saying: \"we're sorry, this is Spirit.\" Delta had no problem boarding me but Spirit had wasted that much of our time that we missed their last flight of the day. Spirit then lost our checked bags for 3 hours while they went to search for them. Their counter simply closed down after their flight departed, also leaving a few people who had missed the flight stranded with NO ONE from the airline to talk to to arrange a re-booking or provide any sort of assistance. Ultimately, we were forced to spend $1,500 to re-book a last minute flight the following morning with US Airways who also had no problem with my green card and getting us on the flight (I also had NO PROBLEMS getting through US Customs in the US). You may think you are ok leaving the US with Spirit (like we did), but their completely incompetent, rude, unknowledgeable, unhelpful staff in Mexico can RUIN YOUR TRIP.

One word RIPOFF. I am not a fussy traveler but Spirit Airlines is a racket plain and simple. Their fine print and viscous hidden fees are an irresponsible way to treat customers. Firstly, Spirit has a draconian check in policy, if you are not checked-in 1 hour before departure they may cancel your ticket EVEN IF you still have time to catch the plane. Secondly, they have a deliberately confusing policy on carry-on luggage, its cleverly designed to rip you off. All airlines allow 1 personal item and 1 carry-on per passenger free of charge, BUT NOT SPIRIT. You are allowed 1 very small bag (tiny back pack or purse) ONLY! If you have any additional carry-ons you will be charged 55$ at check-in! If you didn't catch that gimmick at check in thats ok because THEY WILL CHARGE YOU 100$ AT THE GATE PER CARRY ON!!! All because you missed this commonly over-looked and entirely unique stipulation... if you refuse to pay (as this was understandably causing sheer outrage from several passengers as we boarded) they will leave you (or your luggage) at the airport. Of all the lousy and dishonest ways to make a buck- I was shocked!!!! They also charge an additional $10 for seat selection. So in short my wife and I thought we were saving $30 by flying Spirit- but after 75$ in hidden fees we spent 45$ more flying Spirit then many other airlines who treat their flyers with honesty and dignity. To top it off the plane itself was outdated, sketchy, the seating was like a sardine can and they offer no complimentary beverages or snacks whatsoever. I can deal with lousy air crafts, terrible seating and no complimentary water... but hiding their carry-on policy in fine print and shaking-down desperate travelers with sucker-punch fees at the last minute is really inexcusable and far too irresponsible for me to ever consider booking with them again.

The upside is that I got a cheap flight from Southwest, leaving at a reasonable time.

First: \u00a0if you're reading this, you probably already know, but it's worth saying again: Spirit charges extra for a carryon. As in you have a purse, so that's your personal item--your roller bag will cost extra. Seriously? This feels like buying a hamburger and discovering that they charge you extra for a bun. What is Spirit going to do next--charge you extra if you'd actually like a seat? Second: Got to the airport in Vegas for the return flight WAY early--got a boarding pass, sat around the gate for a couple hours. About 45 minutes before boarding time, I became concerned that the flight number at the gate had not changed to my flight. So I checked the departure board which assured me that the flight was on time and still boarding at gate B2. But 10 minutes later, I got paranoid and looked up the Spirit website on my phone. Hold on--my flight is crossed out. What does crossed out mean? Is it full or something? No--here's a tip: if you find your flight crossed out, be first in line at the desk instantaneously. Not knowing this, I hung around trustingly until about 2:00 (20 minutes before boarding was to start) when they announced that A) the flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues B) there were no more Spirit flights to LA that afternoon C) those who wanted could come talk about staying in a hotel and D) everyone else could go down to the ticket counter and see if they could get re-routed on another airline. Good luck on that one. There was a rush for the exits, and by the time I got to the counter, there were 200 angry people standing in line and the line was not moving. After about 5 minutes of this, I took the 800 number to call about a refund and headed for the car rental place to do what I was trying to avoid in the first place--experience 8 lovely hours of cars packed bumper to bumper across the Mojave (okay--to be perfectly honest, it was \"only\" packed bumper to bumper to State Line.

I flew with Spirit anyways, ignoring the caveats about cramp-inducing legroom and the lack of peanuts. At 6'3 and endowed with an enormous... meticulousness... I can proudly say I will fly with Spirit again.Spirit gets the brunt of a lot of undeserved flack. It is a shame that so many people will lambaste a company before understanding the company's business model or reading the fine print (in Spirit Airline's case, the print is large, bold, and impossible to ignore unless you are carelessly hitting the \"next\" button on their website). Because I had a reasonable experience with Spirit and find its dissenters to have an unhealthy fondness of vitriol and self-entitlement, I think it's only fair that I break down some of the more common criticisms of the airline I've read:1) The baggage fees. Unless you are a Luddist stuck in the 19th century, you probably use the internet to book flights. Yes, if you are using Yelp! to whine about your experience on Spirit airlines, then you must be aware that the internet exists, and you are fully capable of using it to book your flights as well. Spirit's website is very clear about additional baggage fees. The website asks you if you would like to add baggage, provides you with the total cost of checked bags and carry-ons (again, in big, bold letters), and even has a pretty baggage icon for those of you with short attention spans. If you used a travel search engine like Kayak to book a Spirit flight, you were probably drawn to Spirit's incredibly low prices. In this case, you may have been blindsided by Spirit's additional baggage fees upon arrival at your local airport. Nevertheless, ignorance is no excuse. Have you ever heard the expression, \"too good to be true\"? Make that your mantra before you hastily place your travel order like it's some cheap combo meal at a fast food restaurant. Do your research. Be the diligent traveler you aspire to be! (Someone watched too many B-movie, locker room motivational speeches). 2) Lack of entertainment and free nourishment. This one should be simple, even to pea-brained travelers. If you save hundreds of dollars by booking with a budget airline, the airline must have to cut some costs to make up for the lost income, right? All of those free amenities like water, salted peanuts, in-flight movies... those cost money, and those costs add up. An airline that cares to remain in business will charge its customers for those amenities. Unlike most airlines, Spirit provides a budget travel experience to those who can't afford to fly with a major carrier. It is advisable to leave your experiential bias at the door when you fly with Spirit--don't expect a comfortable flight like that one time you flew first-class with your deceased grandparent's trust fund money. Here's a fun analogy: do you ever book a room at a Motel 6 and expect a chocolate on your pillow and a bell boy to haul your bags to your room like a personal sherpa? I didn't think so... Some people fly first class and stay at the Ritz. If you're flying Spirit, you are not one of those people.3) The delays. In a way, I can sympathize with some of the griping I've read about Spirit's all-too-frequent delays. I myself experienced a 3-hour delay flying with Spirit, and I'll admit, it wasn't a favorable turn of events. Once again, however, I'll defend the airline and assume that ignorance is most likely the culprit in most Spirit customers' experiences. Although Spirit may not publicly alert travelers of its delay potential, chances are, if you've written a crappy review of Spirit, you've also read a crappy review of Spirit, in which case, it is likely that you were privy to other customers' \"abysmal\" travel experiences before booking your flight. You knew the risk, and you rolled the dice. So, in the future, if you have a potentially career-advancing meeting to make the same day as your flight, the choice is simple: don't book with Spirit! Spirit has no sympathy for poor planners, and neither should you. In the rare event that your flight is cancelled and your only option is to wait several days before the scarce seating on another Spirit plane opens up, it is then, and only then, that you ought to exercise your American-bred talent for complaining. I have read a couple stories of Spirit customers stranded at airports for days, fending for themselves without food vouchers or complimentary hotel rooms, and for these unfortunate few, I extend my deepest sympathy.All in all, in my Spirit Airlines experience, I saved a gross $200, (a net $180 after I spent $20 at the terminal bar to soothe the sting of the 3 hour delay), and I got to my destination safely, with my bag, a leg cramp, and the relief of being home, just as I have on every other flight with any other airline that has allowed me to experience the miracle of human flight."}, {"count": 3735, "date": "1/2/2014", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Here's the latest on my complaint. \u00a0I got a email from customer service with my letter of complaint attached. \u00a0I got a form email saying Rate our customer service. \u00a0Really!

Well Spirit came to the rescue with a flight in the time frame I needed for less than $250. It was a short trip so I only paid for a carry on which worked just fine for me. The flight attendants were not the most friendly and the seats themselves were somewhat uncomfortable, but I find that to be the case with most airlines to be honest.

Also, if you don't purchase all your bags online, you will pay much more at the airport (up to $100 per bag, even for a carry-on bag). The Spirit website also makes it easy to accidentally accept unnecessary items (e.g., trip/baggage insurance & faster check-in and boarding) by making the reject service option extremely small (in comparison to the large accept service button). The whole flight, I would constantly overhear people complaining about the deceitful extra charges, with one kind lady expressing her sorrow that she paid over $1,000 for a flight she booked 5-months prior. Even though I, and all my friends, ended up paying far more than other airlines, this airline is still a budget airline (e.g., no free water, drinks, or snacks, no reclining seats, no TV, no Wifi, no radio, etc).

When I got to the airport, I had already checked in but the lady told me I had to stand in line because the information on my bag was confusing. My initial conformation email had me down for one Carry on bag and nothing checked, but when I got my boarding pass it printed out that I had one Check in bag and nothing carry on. I went to the counter to make sure of what to do with my bag (just one and it met all TSA requirements, so it wouldn't have mattered how it traveled, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't being charged for both.) When I got to the counter, the agent was very polite and told me that I HAD paid for both bags. I told her I only had the one bag and needed a refund on my carry on since I would be checking the only bag I had. She helpfully handed me a customer service number and told me to call at my earliest convenience to get the refund. I took the number and called as soon as I got home from my trip. When I called the customer service representative, I was met with an attitude as if I was putting her out by calling. I explained what had happened and that I was told I would receive a refund and she proceeded to tell me it was impossible to get a refund. Her exact words were, \"We don't refund bags. Period.\" I asked her if I could speak with her supervisor as I didn't feel it was fair to be charged for a service that I didn't use. She told me that she couldn't get a supervisor because they were all busy assisting other customers and that they would just tell me the same thing anyway. She said that there was no note on my account saying that I was over charged for bags. I told her I could get in touch with the airport and speak with the woman who checked my bag in order to have her make a note. I told her I could even go back \u00a0to the airport in case they needed to see my ID. She told me that even if I did so, and the agent made a note, it was still not possible to get the refund because she didn't note it to the account at the time of travel. In essence, I spent about 20 minutes on the phone trying to understand why I was being charged for something I never used, and I was treated terribly. Not only that, but on both my flights the rides were very bumpy and the planes were dirty. The seats didn't recline and the plane smelled very badly of urine. Both my flights were delayed, and my bag was on the wrong turn-style when I arrived back to DFW. The people I sat next to were so upset about how delayed the flight was and that we didn't receive any compensation for it, and then they found one of their bags on the turn-style for the Oakland flight, and the other bag at the Chicago flight turn-style (which is where I found mine after an hour and a half of waiting for my bag). Overall, I am VERY disappointed with Spirit. I planned on using Spirit again as I fly frequently since my husband lives in CA, and I didn't really mind that they were unorganized and a little dirty because I thought the price would be worth it for only a three hour flight, but when they are rude and basically STEAL money from you for a service you didn't receive BECAUSE they are unorganized, it is unacceptable.

Don't pay for assigned seats. \u00a0Get your seats assigned at the airport and take your chances. \u00a0The flights are so awful, separate seats will be the least of your worries.8.

We paid the fee and took the flight to Vegas. The worst part of our flight was the return flight. We tried checking in online and were unsuccessful and kept getting an error message stating we would be charged $10/person if we checked in with an agent at the airport. Again, more fees. Once at the airport we were greeted by RUDE flight attendants. Then our flight was delayed an hour and fifteen minutes. We were actually kept waiting on the plane I the super uncomfortable seats that don't recline and are extremely space restrictive for about 45 minutes and were not even allowed to get up to use the restroom or stretch. Once we got to LAX, they changed the carousel from where to get our luggage twice and once we got our luggage, our suitcase was slightly open & the couple standing next to us also had their suitcase COMPLETELY opened. What a TERRIBLE airline. They get you by offering low prices but then once you add up all their fees you realize that you could have just paid the extra $100 to fly a better airline as was the case for us.

(The flight attendant I had on my flight from LAX to Cleveland, OH was nice enough to go out of her way to make that small accommodation for me which helped tremendously, so I wanted to see if the same could be done on my return flight.) So anyway, the flight attendant on my return flight told me I couldn't switch seats because it was a weight issue & that they needed to make sure the plane is balanced (I'm of average size, btw just to make that clear..not an obese person by any means..), which, by the way, is bullshit because when you go to check in for your flight online at Spirit's website, they give you the option to pay for where you'd like to sit on the plane & if you opt to not do that, then you will just be placed in any random available seat. So, after the flight attendant said that, the lady sitting behind me said that I could move back to her row with her if I wanted to because the two seats next to her were empty & she was traveling with her small child too, so at least there would be more room for the 4 of us without anyone sitting in the middle seat. Well, miss control freak overheard our conversation & quickly chimed in to say that actually no, we couldn't do that either because technically that would be 4 people to a row & there's only 3 oxygen masks up above, so we'd be short by 1, which was absolutely ridiculous because my original row had me with my son riding on my lap with the 2 seats next to me occupied..is that not 4 people as well? Moron. So her logic, as much as she wanted it to make sense & be justified, was clearly not making sense & certainly not justified. I guess it was just her day to be a bitch & outshine all the others.

Not to mention Southwest has a 50lb. weight limit for their checked luggage..Spirit only allows you 40lb. Also, their planes are filthy! There was dried up liquid still on the seats in front of me from where someone spilled or splashed something..& I managed to get someone's nasty chewed up bubble gum from under my seat all over my pants..I had a heck of a time trying to get that off!

Never ONCE did he mention that I was going to be paying $15 more for my bag just because I had the audacity to want to pay cash and needed to speak with a living, breathing human to do so. I checked in and then headed to the desk. Put my bag on the scale and became excited that it was 46 pounds, well within the 50 pound limit. The woman said nothing except \"That'll be $70.\" Of course I needed to know WHY?! Unlike every single airline in the HISTORY of baggage fees, Spirit Air starts charging overages when your bag weighs more than FORTY POUNDS. When I reacted to this I got a \"That's how it is, pay for your bag or don't get on the airplane\" speech.Once on the airplane, the legroom situation was nonexistent. I am by no means a big person, quite small in fact, and my knees were hitting the seat in from of me. The chairs sit virtually upright even when \"reclined\" all the way back. The flight attendants were kind of snide. One of them was quite large and every single time she walked up and down the aisle she knocked into my shoulders. Never once did she apologize. Given my size, I'm sure I'm not the only person who's shoulders were constantly bombarded by her bum. I also asked for a glass of water, even THAT was three bucks.

Missionary teams across the globe are stunned by the reaction of Spirit Airlines and Picasso Travel at a humanitarian cause, each company say they made donation to Haiti and they wish they could do more but they can't, but what they truly mean is that they won't!

I noticed something is off so I called to make sure there are no \"hidden fees\" or anything of the sort.To my big surprise I've found out that they allow only a small bag/suitcase as a personal items bag and by small I mean 16X14X12 those are the measurements that they allow, OTHERWISE you'd have to check in your bag which is $35 (!!!) for the medium sized case (18X16X14) on-line and if it's before boarding the fee can reach a $100 per case!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Naturally, I have immediately measured my case and found out that I would've paid a lot of money had tried to board with my medium size case.

I preferred paying $30 for a cab to take me to TJ's in Las Vegas and exchange the case to a smaller bag, rather than paying those con-artists another $50, or maybe a $100 depends on their mood...As I was boarding back I felt sorry for the poor victims that fell for this sleazy trick as I have.On top of that, on the flight back, flight was delayed due to \"air traffic in LAX..\" - don't you check those things before scheduling a @#%$#@ing flight?!?SPIRIT AIRLINES - SUCH A PLEASURE!"}, {"count": 4083, "date": "12/27/2011", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "I've used Spirit a few times and don't get all the complaints!

Imagine that, all that great unknown to suffer! :)So, all in all, they did what an airline is supposed to do: \u00a0the flights were on time, and they got me safely to my destinations, and on top of it, didn't cost me an arm and a leg. \u00a0I think it's the same problem that a lot of people have with their phones nowadays when they complain about not enough games or apps -- the phone is supposed to make calls, everything else is additional pleasures (I do have an iPhone, so I do like the extras -- but that's my choice). \u00a0The airline is supposed to transport you... and, if you think you'd like to have all those other things like snacks, being able to preselect a specific seat, etc -- then in today's era of online reviews there's no excuse of not knowing all that in advance, and either accept it the way it is, or pay more to get something else. \u00a0I'd rather pay an honest carrier like Spirit, than overpay United or AA that are no better except free soft drinks, TVs with movies that I'm not necessarily interested in and being able to get a seat assigned online. \u00a0All that is not enough to justify the price difference."}, {"count": 4120, "date": "10/19/2012", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Spirit airlines deserves negative stars....No stars. \u00a0I agree with everyone who was duped by this airline. \u00a0They charged $40 each way for a carry on. \u00a0 Big time \u00a0 Cheats!!!!!!!Not only do they cheat you out of your money but this flight is literally the most disgusting, filthy and repugnant trip of my life. \u00a0The airplane, namely the air Smelled like they were pumping in raw sewage mixed with vomit. \u00a0Everyone on the flight was equally disgusted. \u00a0Just awful!!!!! \u00a0Tell everyone you know to boycott this horrible airline."}, {"count": 4121, "date": "4/20/2016", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Okay, I tried this airline service once again to my dismay.

That's when I was already assuming damn we fuxed! I read about 20 reviews about there delayed and cancelled flights. I proceed to make my way to the counter and ask him about the delay. He kindly tells me that the delay is about only 15 min and the plane is in the air from Vegas to lax. For a brief second I think he is lying but I gave hike the benefit and decide to wait it out. Much to my surprise I see the plan at the gate 1/2 hour later good stuff. Moving along they proceed to board us in zones to stop any pushing or shoving which I like.

I have never flown in a plane in my 26 years of life on this earth. So naturally I was pumped on flying just like a little kid. Only in this case I was left very disappointed because I know good from bad. The staff is very grumpy from the desk to the gate it is all bad. They just don't know how to treat a bag I mean at least pretend to treat it nice until we turn our backs. Also they give you guff when you are asking a few questions. So once I get on the plane I realized that this plane is small yes I am 6'1 about 300 but still I saw \u00a0smaller people struggle to get in the seats. So I was sweating bullets, I ended up shelling out the extra bucks to get the emergency exit seat but I notice it did not make dick of difference. So once they heard us like cattle inside the plane, we take off with no problem. Since we took a red eye it was night and I was trying to sleep. Since I am tall the little fan thing was right in my mouth so about 25 minutes into my nap I wake up choking on a dry mouth. When I try to get some water we have to pay for it. What the fuck we got to pay for water, I understand booze and soft drinks but water. Anyway since the credit card reader was not working I had to manage to get some change to buy a water. Trying to go back to sleep was no easy task to be honest with everyone I think I would have more comfortable trying to take nap in the backseat of a 68 VW bug than on this flight. \u00a0Once we landed I was trying to get out just to stretch out, the flight back from Ft. Lauderdale was just about the same. The only difference \u00a0is they get mad at you is you have a hard time with the kiosk.

And when I arrived in fort Lauderdale FL, the staff were just as rude! I had a problem with my flight, which resulted in a change of flight, the one person who was nice was a manager who assisted me and was very helpful. My flight was changed due to passport problems, which resulted in me not being able to continue my trip, the manager was nice enough to refund me for the part of my trip I wasnt going to take, and set me up with a flight home...that would have earned a great rating, but all the other bad customer service out weighs it.a few examples would be when I got off my flight my boarding pass for my next original flight didnt have a gate nnumber, so when I went to a flight attendant about where I am suppose to gi, she didn't let me finish my question and rudely said my gate number in on my pass, I then explained it wasnt, she rolled her eyes and with an attitude told me where to go...when I had to change my flight the customer service ladies were whatever to me. When the lady printed out my pass it showed no carry on luggage (I had paid for my carry on to all my destinations ) so I told her I had carry on and asked if I had to pay again, she then seemed bothered and said \"while im.not gunna go through that hassle and print another ticket\" and just wrote on the ticktet on.had a carry on luggage with her badge number and said it wouldn't be a problem..it was 0800am my flight wasnt until 930pm at night so I figured id kill some time and go out in the city and shop.....when I asked about where I could go to have my luggage stored while I left, every one had the me going in circles sending me different places and had such attitudes when I asked for helo, I spent 2 hrs only to find out my terminal didnt have one, and was directed to another terminal to drop.it off. I spent the day crying over how bad the day was.going and I wasnt ggoing to my destination but home...when I came back I had such a hassle about my carry on luggage, they almost had me pay again for it, which would have been like $75 when I already paid $50...after finally getting cleared I went in....I was so tires and exhausted and my phone waa about to die so I found a spot on the floor by an outlet to rest and charge my phone, there was an airport wheel chair blocking the outlet, so I simply moved it over just a little bit, later.a.worker came and yelled at me for moving the wheel chair,I barely moved it over it was like I took it to a different spot, he yelled at me in front of alot of ppl and I felt so embarrassed...the final part was when boarding, my pass still said no carry on but had the employee badge number on it who approved it...when \u00a0went up to the boarding desk prior to boarding just to lwt the flight attendant know the situation, he started yelling and saying stufd in Spanish I didn't know, and asked me why they didn't reprint it, I said I didn't knkw but this is what they gave me,he made me go back to ccustomer service to.fix it, even though they already approved it, I came back with the same ticket and told him they said it was fine and he got a angry vouce saying stuff in Spanish I didnt undertand, then grabbed my pass and ripped it and gave me a new one, only for the new.one to still say NO carry on, I asked him if it was gunna be a problem boarding he said no, but of course at boarding time it WAS a problem and HE acted like I was just telling him what happened for the first time and acted like he didn't know anything, which almost made me miss my flight....after such a bad day and bad experience, I didnt need this kind of treatment.....I wil never ever ever fly with spirit ever again!!!"}, {"count": 4213, "date": "2/19/2013", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THE $9 Fare with Spirit Airlines!!!!!

The decision was made, they would fly Spirit and I would fly separately on another airline. But, after much arguing and discussion I relented.

There was a guy that came on the plane with his dog, a very big dog. The flight attendant, Jenny, I believe was her name, she was asking people to switch seats to accommodate him and his dog. She asked the lady in seat 2C, she said no. She asked the lady in seat one, she said no. And then she came to me and asked if I mind switching with a guy, who's a soldier and his dog. I told her that I didn't want to. Then infront of everyone, she said, well you were nice enough to switch with the other lady, so I thought you would be nice enough to switch with the solider. Then everyone turned around to stare at us, which was embarrassing. Then I tried to explain, that we are already going to be 3.5 hours late, I'm late for work, so me sitting in the back, I will be another 30 minutes late, getting off the plane. Then she follows with, well, this isn't your original seat, so we will may just have to move you. I told her that she didn't tell the lady in seat number 2 or 1 that she \"may\" have to move them, so she wasn't going to move me. Then she left and came back and asked if I could at least move to the middle seat for him, which I did. And then on top of all of this, there was no apologies for being delayed, no accommodations, not even free water or snacks, they were still charging. But the flight attendant gave the so-called \"soldier\", and I say so-called, because he's young and says he's in the reserved, parttime, meaning, he hasn't been on the battle field. But he asked Jenny for some water and she gave it to him before we even took off and said that she will charge him later, but never did. And then later, he stopped the other flight attendant and asked for a soda, and said that she would have to charge him cash and he said that he didn't have cash and he said never mind. Then I heard her ask him if he's okay? He said yes, then she said is there something wrong with your stomach? He looked confused. Then she said, well since you are not feeling well, I will get you a soda. When she came back, she gave him a soda, and said if he isn't feeling well, she doesn't have to charge him for the soda. Oh, did I mention, Jenny didn't thank me after she asked me to move for him and I did. Yeah, she didn't, she was completely rude. And I am going to make sure that this message is posted everywhere.

And I had no idea about this until I arrived at the gate this am. The Spirit reps at the gate were nice-ish, but couldn't do anything. The supervisor was rude and talked over me and wouldn't let me speak. He said he could give a partial refund and then I'd be on my own to contact another airline and try to find a later, more direct flight (and of course I'd end up paying more for that because a partial refund doesn't cover a last-minute booking). I ask if he can at the very least put me in 1st class to make my hellish experience with Spirit a little less awful, but he just brushed me off.

Luckily, we were able to fit our clothes into a purse and laptop bag that fit the requirements for their allotted \"personal item\" to avoid the outrageous fee. Suck on that, Spirit. Also, don't come onto the plane thirsty because they charge you for water. Long story short, we ended up spending more than the alternative airline, and had a miserable time doing it.
