They still wouldn't let me take that flight back. They didn't care and just kept denying this was money making. I asked them \"so you're willing for a platinum member to go to another airline now\" and yes they were. So now I've cancelled my flight and the credit will now cover my new flight on a different airline and some left over. What a shame I was willing to stick with them even though I'd save money, but they had no care about helping me.

The only cool thing was the flight attendant from sf to LA. So, at SFO the old plane that smelled like farts air wasn't working and the pilot informed us and even said that it was odd that the same control for the air conditioning also starts the jet engine and they can jump start the jet engine with the plane tire air-pump. Seriously! I wanted off but can't, like how can airlines which are essentially flying greyhound buses at this point have so much control, imagine if I wanted off and actually notified the fuss it would cause. At LAX I have never been treated so poorly as a customer. Overall Mickey Mouse operation, look how they started the jet engine! Flight 504 thanks for the hour of terror of flying around at 32,000 ft knowing I'm in a plane with an engine that won't start unless jumped with a tire air-pump, so basically flying around in a plane that has just had jet engine failure. Can I just not have this ever happen again, like why is this a problem I ever should even have to face?!! Instead of updating your fleet you use fart-smelling old planes with failing jet engines that are jumped with plane tire air-pumps. Or how about grounding it and properly servicing it to start properly? How are we as a society literally going to mars and mining the moon for resources yet failing so tragically in so many aspects of our existence? It's going to be year 2020 and it's time all get our eyes checked to see 20/20 and what is happening around us. It's time for corporate greed to stop, I bet upper management would never, NEVER!, be on a plane like this, cut CEO/Company President salaries and fix your fleet! What a shame!!!...Also, I've done reading of sociology studies about monetary wealth and happiness and from what I have read ultimate human happiness occurs in the salary range of $45,000-$75,000 for an adult so all these people accumulating massive wealth are not happier or more blessed in fact probably the opposite. Massive wealth can bring sad feelings and sick to the stomach pains of buyers remorse or other feelings that make you want to vomit, it's real. It's starts out wonderful of every material item you dreamed of appearing, then you start accumulating, then excess, then you buy a Birkin bag you don't need and have to vomit for no reason other that greed pulsating through your aura and you must purge. It's True! Also, from what I have read, not many studies done kinda taboo topic, but the monetary value of true friendship per year is $80,000-$120,000. So never let anyone take away your spirit, just you showing up with positivity and being true brings more happiness than money can buy. So American Airlines you may have won this battle but I am going to tell as many people about you as possible so we will see who wins in the end, word of mouth goes farther than any marketing. A matter of fact the airline ticketing system needs a makeover and we still using ancient seat assigning technology from the 50's, like get that fixed too. Do your job losers, and be COMPETENT for once. I am deeply offended to my core soul of being placed on a plane with jet engine failure and the hostile culture of the staff of the airlines make this not ok, not talking about flight attendant here she was cool but there was absolutely no way of getting off this flight without causing a big commotion- think about it.

We booked a flight from LA to Cabos. After 16 years of Traveling around the world, with many different domestic and international Airlines , American Airline by far can and should be ranked the worst in Aviation History. Firstly, who puts a restriction on your reservations, basically denies any basic traveling needs. They also put restrictions that you can't choose your own seats. You cant even Buy ( Pay for ) un upgrade.Basically Your only allowed to board the airplane with the cloths your wearing. They charge for a small carry on Luggage, where for the past 10 Years Most of the airlines around the world DO NOT charge anything extra .With American Airline they are very close to charging people for using the Lavatory. You barely get a glass water, this is outrageous.The service and the staff are just another depressing chapter, You can easily See how unhappy they are , least Helpful staff you could come across from the counter, when you check in, to the staff on board the airplanes .Add to that, the hideous super Tight Seats( Sardine Style ) the seats are so tight, you can tell all they want is to add as many seats on the aircraft as Possible .As well as No inflight entertainment system. Stone-age old airplanes and cheap Airline, is the ideal name for this company.And lastly looking at their Yelp & Google Review pages, show how much the corporation cares about people feedback or our opinions all together.It is sad there are no competitive Airlines domestically, like In Europe or Asia .

We just finished a 7 day cruise for our honeymoon and had a flight home booked (MIA to DIA) that was supposed to depart at 9:34 PM. The flight ended up departing at 8:00AM the next morning. I wouldn't be as upset if I didn't have a panic disorder and as a first time cruiser, I had no idea how dizzy I would be afterwards. The dizziness almost always triggered a panic attack, and I felt completely helpless at MIA. We were given many different excuses over the course of the night. First, it was a problem with the seats where the bars on the back of the seats were unable to lock and hold people's carry on bags. Maintenance was called to \"fix\" the seats. Then, it was announced that at least 20 carry on bags \"had\" to be checked in because there was not going to be enough overhead space. We were told that the quicker we did this, the quicker we could depart, so people rushed over with their bags to check in. My husband stood in line with our relatively large carry on duffel bag only to be told that it was too small (???) to check in. We all continued to wait, and then we were told that we would be switching to another plane that wasn't arriving for another couple hours. We all were moved to a different terminal. That plane arrived and guess what? Now there was not a crew able to fly the plane. We were told that a crew had been located but some of them had to \"commute\" so they didn't know when the crew would arrive. At this point, I think it was close to midnight. We had been at the airport since noon, similar to many other people. Meanwhile, the American Airlines flight next to us had been boarded and then everyone had to get off the plane. People were angry and police were called. One of the excuses was that the flight attendant was \"lost\". Then when she arrived, there were more excuses. We were brought pillows, blankets, and a food cart. People were exhausted, solo travelers were scared, kids were terrified. We asked the worker at the desk if she thought the flight would be cancelled. She told us it was a \"50/50 chance\" (yeah, no kidding) when another passenger we were speaking with was told there was no chance it would be cancelled.We continued to tough it out until the flight was ultimately moved to 8AM, and we were told to go get vouchers for a hotel, shuttle, and food. People started running, there was little direction from airline and airport employees, and the line was incredibly long and slow moving. All the while, I am feeling like I'm going to pass out. Since the flight wasn't technically cancelled, all of our luggage was going to stay on the plane, including the carry on bags that people had just checked in after they were rushed by the airline to do so. At that point we wanted to cancel and fly out of Fort Lauderdale, but felt like we were trapped due to the fact that they were holding our luggage. It was nearly impossible to get any sort of direction as far as where we needed to go to get on our shuttle. After waiting outside after midnight in the wrong spot for 30 minutes, a worker wearing all white smoking a cigarette casually told us that we needed to go back inside and go down the elevator to reach the shuttle pick up. The couple with us didn't speak English well and were having a hard time figuring out where to go - you'd think the employee would give us a little more direction but his cigarette appeared to be more important.We finally got on our shuttle at around 1AM. We felt lucky to have all the vouchers we needed because 99% of the other people we were speaking to were missing a voucher, whether it was for transportation or the hotel or whatever it may be. We were thankful that the hotel was beautiful. We only got to be there about 3 hours before the shuttle came to get us and take us back to the airport. Thankfully there were no more delays with the flight. We paid for upgraded seating and ended up in an exit row next to a flight attendant who texted the entire time. The whole experience was just unpleasant and very scary, whether you have a panic disorder or not.We saw people in a lot of pain, likely because they were rushed to check on their carry on bags and might not have had the medication they needed. This could have been a serious health issue. I will never reccomend American Airlines.

I've flown with American for a number of times and there were never really any issues. The only issue that I've ever had was a small 20 minute delay because of heavy rain and winds. Not the fault of the individual airline as it is a safety standard for all airlines. I normally arrive 30-40 minute early from boarding time so this way I won't run into any problems about missing flight and gate closed on me. Plan ahead people! I've flown in different cabins on AA and the service I get is great every time. There was one time where I was the last one to get on a busy flight from LAX to Logan and I had a little problem finding space for my carry on luggage. The super nice flight attendant (I don't remember your name, sorry!) went out of her way to help me stow away my carry on luggage. She helped me adjust some spaces that were on some overhead bins and lifted my luggage up for me. As it was a full flight the flight attendant at the main cabin still attended to everyone and asked if we needed anything throughout the flight. Even on shorter routes with American Eagle, the service were great. The FA comes around every so often asking if I needed anything. Their domestic first is a really good experience. The FA on the first class cabin comes around really often to ask if you need anything and will always make sure you are properly attended to. There's a pre-departure drink while you are seated and on the ground. You get handed warm towels shortly after takeoff and meal service begins a few hours into the flight. As for in flight entertainment, this is one of the best in domestic travels. The screen are high res and has a lot of options to choose from. I normally watch 2-3 movies and that's pretty much the duration of the flight. Their selection is good as the movies are relative new movies. I do hope that I never run into problems that others have experienced such as missing connecting flights, being dragged off a plane and gates already closed on them. But if a problem can be avoided by being delinquent, then be delinquent. If you blame the airline for closing the gate on you, try your best to arrive earlier! Don't wait until the last possible minute to get to the airport and then harass the employees at the gate for your tardiness. There are unforeseen circumstances that might cause a flight to be delayed, things happen. And I'm pretty sure that AA does not want to cause these delays either.

American Airlines is the single worst airline I have ever flown. I bought an itinerary to fly down to DFW from SFO on Friday to Sunday of this past weekend. I then had to be down there on Thursday night, I called American to see if they could help me switch my flight, they told me it would be cheaper to just buy another flight. So I bought the second flight (also through American mind you) on Thursday night. While this was frustrating, I understood that I bought an Economy ticket and they would not roll out the red carpet for me, so I am not mad about that.I took my Thursday night flight, actual flight itself wasn't terrible. $9 cocktails is a bit high but nothing to0 ridiculous.After I thoroughly enjoyed most of weekend in Dallas, I tried checking into my Sunday flight on Saturday night. It said the system was down and I would have to check-in in the morning, which happened to be the morning of my nephew and Godson's baptism. I tried checking in before the service, same issue. So I called American...They cancelled my itinerary. They cancelled my itinerary because I was a \"no-show on my initial flight to Dallas.\" So I was stranded after I had flown to Dallas via American because American didn't know I was in Dallas...starting to see why I am so angry? Anyway, I was forced to miss the baptism party to make sure I could get back to SFO the same night and had to be on the phone with AA customer service. The AA customer service line had zero empathy for my situation and functionally told me to \"f*** off, we cant help you.\"So I decided to go to the airport and try to explain myself. I have never been treated like less of a human. It seems as if American has a training to make their customer service people as cold and heartless as physically possible to the economy passengers. To name the two I dealt with, avoid Nathaniel and Ganga at DFW, they are the least sympathetic people on planet earth and have no business being in the workforce. Ganga particularly wouldn't look me in the eye, but American will not address this because I am worth less than dirt as I am an \"economy passenger.\" I was forced to buy an additional $600 ticket to get home. Then, when my co-rider had the audacity to try to get on my flight as a standby passenger they told her that she would need to buy a new ticket as well.I would rather drive than ever fly American again.

It seems by the Yelp performance summary that this is most AA passenger's experience.From check in at the departure airport to arrival at the destination, the staff is excessively rude. After cancelling my departure flight which kicked off a 2 week, 3 city trip, no solution was sought after. Not one representative attempted to make things right and the only option for my girlfriend and I to maintain our travel schedule was to purchase two new tickets out of pocket, day of. After an attendant attempted to forcefully remove my carry on bag from my hand during boarding (because at their \"professional\" glance it was not an appropriate carry on size), I returned to the bridge entrance and demonstrated that it does in fact fit in the carry-on sizing tool, and without any struggle at all.More and more of the same throughout the entire experience. AA staff not only missed every opportunity to shine, but they antagonized it. Most appalling was what I witnessed from a flight attendant towards a very frail, elderly passenger. Upon landing, this lady was attempting to remove her bag from the overhead compartment that she was hardly capable of reaching at all. Having sat in the back, the plane is nearly vacated at this point and in the back half of the plane is the lady struggling, two attendants, and my girlfriend and I. Seeing the lady's struggle, I began her way to lend a hand, but an attendant that was relaxing in a seat ahead of me took the aisle and headed her way. She did not approach with an intent to help this poor lady... instead she urged her to hurry up and exit the aircraft. She stood overbearingly close to her and forcefully shouted at her to get off the plane. As crazy as this sounds, I had to step in and defend this lady, help her retrieve her bag and get off the plane without being terrorized any further.American Airlines, not only did you lose a customer forever, but you've earned a complaint to the BBB.

We arrived at LAX late and taxied for 20mins before the captain finally explained that the delay was due to traffic and light rain. My layover at LAX was only 50mins, so by the time I disembarked I only had 10mins before my gate closed. Your boarding pass specifically states and boxes \"gate closes 10mins before departure.\" I promptly inform AA gate staff that my gate closes in 10mins to which they just point to a massive line to transfer from 52G (remote terminal) to Terminal 4. Many on the line for the transfer bus were headed to HK, like me, so I figured AA would do something to ensure we all boarded. Boy was I WRONG! 10 of us finally arrive at our gate 5mins before departure and the gate manager shrugs to tell us the gate has closed and points us to customer service. Obviously many of us were disgruntled and many other flights were delayed and people had missed their connecting flights to other cities so the line for customer service was out the room. Customer service staff were incredibly rude to customers by showing their temper, threatening to have them removed, and even called in their manager for their lunch break while 30 of us waited to be served.

The first time was in August of 2017, where they allowed a very obvious drunk to get on the plane, that caused a scene when we landed in Charlotte. This kept us on the plane even longer and cause a few of us to almost miss our connecting flight. Then on my return flight from BWI to Charlotte, to Augusta, I had a small overlay, which turned into a 6 hour overlay, because of maintenance. Now I'm glad they're willing to fix planes before taking off, but why are they breaking in the first place. Probably because of the 1980's aircraft they're still flying with. Yes, they still have the old school armrest ash trays. Fast forward to the past few days. Some things are out of control of the airlines, such as allowing a screaming baby to fly on a plane, or having severely overweight people allowed to purchase a ticket for 1 seat when they clearly needed 2. I blame modern society for business not being allowed to fat shame, or ask irresponsible parents to not bring an infant on board. Or not getting one in flight complimentary snack because the turbulence was so bad. I get those are out of the airline's controls, but they could at least do a better job at mitigating these annoyances by being a better company. The trip from Augusta to Charlotte, wasn't bad, which is the only reason I gave a 2 star instead of a 1 star. From Charlotte to BWI, I not only had a screaming child next to me, but I didn't get my pretzels and drink. Again, maybe a more comfortable seat would've helped mitigate the screaming child, or not having someone so overweight next to me that i was literally pressed against my armrest because the one between us couldn't be down based on their size alone. \u00a0The trip from BWI to Charlotte was horrifying. There was a lot of weather situations happening, tornados and stuff along the east coast, which was fine, the company can't control the weather. But I wish that was the cause of my distress. Nope. Once again, someone clearly on substances was allowed to board. He spent the entire trip mumbling to himself and then saying \"yeah yeah yeah yeah\" over and over. Now at first i thought mental disability, but turns out, no, he was high. I figured people trained in the art of making you take off your shoes and belt would have been able to catch this. Or maybe the people allowing him to board. Nope, that's twice they allowed a threat to get on board a plane, one that I was on. And that wasn't even the worst part. The worst part came when we were at our gate, but because of a technical issue, we were literally stuck on the plane for 1 hour and 20 minutes because they couldn't get the gate to connect to the door. So after 1 hour and 20 minutes they FINALLY decided to move us to another gate. Yes, more people missed their connecting flights. I was lucky enough to have had a 3 hour layover. But then... Oh this was the icing on the cake. Because of a STAFFING issue, yes staffing, not maintenance, not technical difficulties, but staffing, our boarding was delayed once again, while we were in line, AT THE GATE. This was because of the poor planning of American airlines... and literally nothing else. The flight attendant was super pleasant though on the way from Charlotte to Augusta, and that made for a really pleasant conversation and flight. I'm thankful for the attendants, but the rest of the company needs a definite overhaul. If you'd like to hire me part time and for a short time, I'm sure I'd love to get the minimal amount of training required to understand your inner workings, do a complete overhaul of your poor management structure, and make you company a much better company.

As an employee, avoid American Airlines if you want to be treated fairly.---- Details: During my trip from New York to Madrid, nearly 5 hours after sitting in the plane, we were flying above the Atlantic when the captain announced there is a malfunction of the plane and we had to return to New York. We landed back in New York around 12:30AM. American Airlines told us they cannot find us another flight and somehow decided to have only six agents with six computers to manually re-schedule 260 passengers individually, which in itself caused all passengers to stand in line for 5 hours from 12:30 AM to 5:30AM without rest or sleep. After more than 24 hours of delay, I finally arrived in Madrid, only to find out at the airport when I was ready to fly back to New York, that my two return flights have been canceled.During the whole incident, I have probably gotten in touch with at least five different agents from various positions from American Airlines, all of which insisted they had no authority to discuss compensation and it is out of their power to help me in any way. Including referring me to someone higher up who might have the authority.This incident surfaced too many problems within American Airlines. Had their engineers did their job correctly before flight departure, we wouldn't have to only discover the plane was in no shape to fly only in the middle of the Atlantic. Had their managers tried their best to get all 260 of us onto a whole other new flight, we wouldn't have to stand for 5 hours in the middle of the night and their poor six agents didn't have to work overnight and manually rebook each of us one-by-one. Had they cared about their employee's well-being, the agent might not have made the mistake of canceling my returning flights.Had they cared about their customers, they would have offered compensations like vouchers and millages to us as Delta or Southwest did with their customers.When you fly with American Airlines you can get this sense that their employees really do not want to be where they are working at. They have this grumpiness attitude and really want to rush through anything they do, from finding you a new flight to giving you directions, to serving beverages. There was even once when I asked the flight attendant for some drinking water, she told me to go sit back at my seat because they will be serving beverages soon (note this is when the seatbelt sign was off which indicated I was free to get up from my seat, and we all know that the beverages cart only comes around for 2 times after the meal carts during the entire flight). The same request was given to JetBlue or Delta, they would give me a small water bottle to keep or at least a cup of water.If you don't have to fly American Airlines, it would be worth it to add some bucks and avoid them. There are many airline choices flying domestically or internationally. As of now, American Airline's level of service doesn't deserve to survive the market."}, {"count": 176, "date": "9/2/2019", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "I flew in from LAX to Atlanta Hartford on the 4:04pm to 11:34pm to Atl.

If a human who is sitting behind you in the Economy Seating decides to put their feet into the back of your Economy Seat - (You Will Feel It)!!! It is no different than having their shoes directly into your back. AMERICAN AIRLINES Economy Seating simply has no structure to the backs of the seats. It is simply thin leather and some foam padding on the other side of the back pocket that holds the flight information packet and a magazine..3.

The flight was to depart at 7:55am. We did not take off until closer to 9:30am due to \"maintenance issues (ice valve issue & refill gas). We sat on the runway for almost 1.5 hours and did not arrive into CLT until 10:50AM. While I certainly understand that unexpected maintenance issues may arise, we were supposed to arrive at 10:08 with a connecting flight to CHS at 11:20am. No one from American bothered to contact our subsequent flight to notify them that we were running behind nor were we provided with any updates about our anticipated departure or new arrival time. When we did finally arrive, my fianc\u00e9 and I ran to the gate and arrived at 11AM. The flight was departing at 11:20 and the gates were not supposed to close until (input time here). Nevertheless, we were informed by the gate agent, Derwin, who was extremely RUDE, that the flight was booked and our seats had been given away! I do not understand how our seats could be given away when the flight did not yet leave and passengers were still boarding when we arrived? Moreover, how are stand-by passengers bumping us when we are in boarding group 6 and they were still boarding group 8? Why did the captain or tower not notify the gate agent about the delayed flight? When I then asked Derwin how he planned to remedy this situation, we were told we could not be guaranteed any seats on the next flights to CHS at 1 or 2:30pm as the flights were fully booked and would need to take an 8:30pm flight. Again, I don't understand how we could be dropped from our flight by stand-by passengers and then told to wait until 8:30pm to depart for our final destination. Unfortunately, we had a wedding rehearsal dinner scheduled at 3pm that day so departing at 8:30pm was not an option. Thus, we were forced to rent a car in Charlotte and drive 3.5 hours to CHS, which then made us late to our rehearsal dinner! I find it ridiculous and absurd that our seats were given away when we were at the gate 20 minutes before departure due to an airline maintenance issue and had to spend our own money to rent a car and pay for gas/parking. I understand reviewing your policy that you do not typically refund gas or car transportation, but as you can see from the transpired events, this was American's fault for giving away our seats and having an airline maintenance issue which caused us to arrive to our connecting flight later than expected. We were inappropriately dropped from the flight and offered no form of compensation as you could not get us on any later flights due to overbooking. We booked these flights in November and were never even contacted before our tickets were given away! According to DOT, we are entitled to a written statement explaining why we were bumped \u00a0& denied boarding compensation. \u00a0I am writing to AA to request reimbursement for the rental car, gas, and parking as well as flight vouchers for the horrendous customer service I received."}, {"count": 280, "date": "6/9/2019", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "HORRIBLE customer service.

I had an encounter with one of the ticketing agents from American Airlines at the Charlotte hub. Her name was Jacqueline. I went to her to ask her if she could switch my ticket to another flight, because they cancelled a flight I was supposed to be on to get back home to Phoenix. With all of the stress of traveling for 12+ hours, the hustle and bustle in the airport around the holidays, and them delaying/cancelling flights all day, you can imagine that I wasn't having the best day so far, but I still approached her calmly and respectfully. I don't know if this girl was having a hard night or what, but when I was trying to get clarification on what flights were available for me to get to Phoenix, she just kept saying, \"I don't know.\" To make a long story short, the woman made it seem like I was being rude and told me she was calling her supervisor! I asked why she was calling her supervisor when I was just trying to get information. I said, \"I am just trying to get on the next flight that I can. I've been in the airport since 11:30 PM yesterday.\" She didn't help me, wasn't answering my question for some reason, and then said \"If you're gonna be rude, I'm gonna call my supervisor.\" Very weird, because I wasn't being rude! At this point, I am frustrated and annoyed. I told her to give me my ticket back and I got help from another ticket agent who was helpful and he \u00a0successfully booked another flight for me to Tucson that night.After this, a strange woman approached me all of a sudden me and told me we need to talk. I asked who she was because she just started talking without even introducing herself. Her approach was, \"I've gotten complaints from several of my employees about you.\" She threatened to cancel my flight. I told her \"If you guys do this you're gonna be in so much trouble.\" When I tried to talk and make sense of the whole situation, this person kept cutting me off. She was so condescending, very rude and just plain unprofessional. She goes, \"Oh, Kristen!\", which is not my name and walks away! She ended up cancelling my ticket. I found out when it was time for me to board and the rep told me I was no longer on the flight list although I had gotten the ticket from the other rep a few hours earlier. Joanie was the CSM's name and she \"inadvertently\" dropped me from the flight, so I had to wait even longer, still not knowing when I was going to make it home after this nightmare.I finally had the opportunity to catch another flight to Tucson and I got on the plane as a standby passenger. A flight attendant removed me and 3 other passengers from the plane because someone had reported the plane was overweight, so I waited again in the terminal. That's where I saw Joanie again at the front counter (as you can see in the pictures), this time on the phone as I waited patiently to try to get on yet another flight to get home. By this time, it's been about 14+ hours of me dealing with American Airlines. There was a small altercation between her and a different customer service rep there. During their conversation, they established Joanie had made a mistake about the plane being overweight, so then me and the 3 other passengers were allowed back on the plane.People need to be very careful when choosing to travel via this airline.

It's silly and irritating that the gate attendants make passengers wrinkle their clothes to walk less than 100 feet on a jet bridge before the flight attendants take the clothes for hanging. It's clearly a policy enforced by the airline and not just by one gate attendant on a power trip, since this happened on every leg of my trip with American.

I am an European citizen and Europeans need a Visa to enter the US, this visa can be made in 15 minutes online, with no problem. So here is the story: I was in the airport two hours before the flight (like it is reccomended for international flights) went directly to the check in, when I arrived in the desk (after making a small interview with on agent of A A) the lady asked my for my passport and than the ESTA, I said that I was not going to the US but to Mexico, and I didn't had an ESTA. The lady said \"ah ok, wait there for my colleague that he will explain for you about the ESTA.\" This colleague was the same that made the interview with me a few minutes before. He was on the phone and I waited for him. When he finished the call, he looked at me and said: \"So you don't have an ESTA? Then unfurtunetly you will not make into this flight!\"I was shocked.I told him that I was not going to the US, that I already had past Visas and had been many times to the US without problem. Then he said \"well this old VISAs are expired, you will need to get the flight tomorrow, we can rebook it for you, just go to the desk across the room and we will relocate you for tomorrow.\" I said: \"If you can rebook me without charge I can fly tomorrow.\"He: \"I didn't said it was without charge.\"I asked: \"Can I make it online right now?\"He: \"The check in is closing now\"I: \"but it's more than one hour before the fight! I only have a carry on.\"He: \"yes but the Check-in is closing, you don't have time.\"*personal question: why didn't he asked me if I had the ESTA before, during the interview.*I went to this desk, couldn't find it immediately, asked other people from the airport where was it. Arrived at the desk an no one was there. Came back to the check-in desk, asked why nobody was there. They said \"they will come soon.\" OK...Than I looked there was a girl that arrived after me with her phone trying to fill the ESTA. Then I asked the man: \"why is she trying to fill the ESTA if you said the check in is closed?\"He: \"because she had already started an application (or something like that).\"Then I asked: \"so can I also make it?\"He: \"It depends how fast you can do it...\"*can you imagine how pissed I was at that moment? Why didn't he said that before?!* I started doing it, shaking because I was so nervous.A few minutes after he said: \"check-in is closed!\"The girl got in, I didn't. What makes me angry is the fact that if they had told me from the moment I was at the check-in desk that I had 20 minutes to make the ESTA, I could make it. I was there before the check in was closed, I could clearly make it on time. But they lied to me, they made me waste my time. I could do the ESTA in 10 minutes.They could have done so many things to get me in this flight, but they simply didn't.Long story short, they didn't rebook my flight because I bought it from a travel agency and I lost everything. Not going to Mexico anymore and lost \u20ac680,00 (ticket price) lost hotel reservation and another flight that I had inside Mexico.All that because they were not willing to let me in, and probably the flight was overbooked. I cried so much that I had a super strong headacke.I will never flight with American Airlines again in my life.

During take off, I heard a loud pop and the plane became very shaky. I knew there was something wrong. The flight attendants announced we've lost a tire and brake, prepare for emergency landing, know where the emergency exits are and get into brace position. It was terrifying, but our plane landed safely in Seattle. After exiting the plane, we had to see an agent to rebook our flights. The agent told me my next flight will be in 10hrs plus another 5hrs in Dallas, because all other flights were completely full. I was shocked, I told her I don't want to be stranded at the airport for 15hrs. I asked her if there were 1st class seats available and she said Yes, but I would have to pay more money for it. Wtf? How is that fair? She said nothing she can do about it and can't honor me those 1st class seats.\u00a0 I bought a direct flight and ended up having to do a total layover of 15hrs . When I arrived to my destination, they lost my luggage! Took a very long time for them to find it. I lost 1 night of hotel stay and an entire day.I called the airline company and spoke to an agent named Marion about this matter. He suggested I put all this in writing online and wait for a company agent to email me. He also said they would most likely pay for the hotel loss. A couple days later, I had a response from an agent named Tio Gain. She did not even offer me any compensation. Basically all she said was sorry and my comments will help improve the company and to give them another opportunity to serve me better next time. After 3 back and forth emails, she finally offered me a $100 voucher which isn't even enough to cover a cost of 1 ticket. She told me that was the best she could do for me and nothing more. My friend who was traveling with me, also sent out an email and her agent offered her a $175 voucher. I asked Tio why was the other agent able to give more to my friend? She responded that it depends on different agents and management. This just shows how inconsistent this company is. It depends on who you're dealing with, not all agents are the same. Some may be more generous than others. Later on she sent me another email saying she can match my friend's $175 voucher. She lied to me about not being able to give me more than $100.The company also tried to deny how the aircraft's delay was not due to mechanical issues and said it was due weather which is unpreventable. Such liars! This whole emergency landing in Seattle even made it into the news and I have a link to prove it. I sent it to the agent and she says it doesn't matter because in the records it states that it was due to weather. Made absolutely no sense. Did the wind blew off the brake and tire during take off? LIARS! My whole experience with this company from beginning to end was a disaster. I've been lied to and treated very unfairly. I told them I would've been satisfied with a refund or a full ticket voucher, but they denied that. I refused the $175 voucher because that means I would still have to put out some money for a complete cost of a ticket and I didn't want to give them another dollar of mine. If they really wanted me to give them a second chance then they should at least give me a full ticket for free. I gave them several chances to make things right with me, but unfortunately they don't care about their customers and reputation.

This is what I know. Customers should come first since this is a service industry. Once you put on the uniform, you're representing your company, not just yourself. Your company's values are at the forefront, not yours. If you disagree with their values, then, perhaps you are working for the wrong airline. The airlines in Asia (can't speak to other continents since Cathay Pacific is based in Asia) are competitive, so their service tends to be superior. I've heard unsavory reviews about American Airline's service and food, but I booked my recent flight from NYC Rome NYC because it was part of British Airline's One World alliance. I should have stuck to my instincts about not flying on an American-based airline on an international flight. First of all, the inflight entertainment system wasn't working, and for a 7.5 hour flight, that's a long time without movies or TV. You'd think the flight attendants would be a tad more friendly to make up for that, but you'd be mistaken. Not only were there not so, they were downright rude and inattentive. Call buttons were left unanswered for hours, I kid you not. Twice, they shut mine off without coming to ask what I wanted. The one time someone did, I was told to go to the galley if I wanted a big bottle of water (by the way, the food was HORRENDOUS). When I went to pick up one of the bottles of water on the cart, I was YELLED at by this other flight attendant. In another experience, there were four available seats at the back of the plane. The woman stuck between my husband and me (he likes the window seat, and I the aisle) asked if she could move to one of those seats and was told that they were \"for emergency.\" It turns out they were kept for flight attendants to sleep four seats across on the flight. Nice that THEY got to sleep comfortably while we tried to catch a wink crammed and upright.I can go on about the unpleasant events on that one leg, but the list is too long. Shame on you, American Airlines. If you can't be bothered with your passengers' needs, you shouldn't be in the service industry. The gist is, DON'T FLY WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES IF YOU CAN HELP IT!

A \"necessary evil\" to be tolerated in order to make a profit? Is it so difficult to understand that passengers are WHY you're in business? \u00a0Passengers will either make or break your business. \u00a0You know this on an intellectual level but it hasn't permeated the SOUL of your company. \u00a0I have an idea: \u00a0please think about traveling \"incognito\" on one of your flights: \u00a0after Thanksgiving, with 2 kids, various carry-on stuff and mind-numbing fatigue added for good measure. \u00a0THEN, fly Southwest, Alaska, JetBlue. \u00a0In particular, fly Flights AA1752 ( BWI-PHX) and AA5736 (PHX-LGB), November 25, 2018. \u00a0I'm pretty darn sure you'd never fly your own airline. \u00a0Southwest, Alaska, JetBlue have their customer service DOWN. \u00a0It's \"baked-into\" their business model. \u00a0 Not so much at AA. \u00a0It's an optional ingredient. \u00a0I'm sure you're a nice guy, but the passengers only contact or face of AA, are the flight attendants etc. \u00a0You get the general premise. \u00a0I'm a lifelong, frequent international and domestic traveler. \u00a0I flew the aforementioned flights. \u00a0Technically great flight: smooth landings, keeping passengers appraised, timely. \u00a0BUT, the flight attendants for the most part either:1) Loathe their jobs;2) Loathe the passengers; or3 BothBoth flights, the attendants are apathetic to passengers in need of help. \u00a0I'm not asking a lot here, but if you SEE someone obviously struggling with luggage and the mash of people in the aisle, you might want to help? On AA1752, I was really struggling with carryons etc. \u00a0I know what you're thinking : \u00a0\"Travel light!\" I know that adage but this was just one of those times with children. \u00a0In particular, as I was struggling I glanced over at a middle-aged blonde-silver(?)haired attendant standing in the rear galley, doing nothing. \u00a0I guess my glance was \"You think you could lend a hand? Not a chance in hell, this lady just looked at me with such derision and the most condescending sneer on her face. \u00a0Like WTF?

If your flight leaves out of TBIT, you might have a long walk from Terminal 4, while if your flight is on American Eagle, you'll have quite an annoyingly long and cramped shuttle ride from either Terminals 4 or 5.

There were 2 incidents on my round trip flight from IND to DFW that have left me alarmed by the customer service/attitude of American Airlines. On my departing flight, I brought my Baby Jogger double stroller as I was traveling with 3 children 4 years old or younger. This was checked at Gate B9 in IND. At the conclusion of the flight, I waited for my stroller outside of the plane. My stroller and car seat bag were visible sitting on the tarmac outside at the bottom of the stairs. These items were left unattended as I stood there with my 3 children. All but 1 of the crew that evening walked by me without even a thought to helping me out. Finally, someone asked me what was going on. I explained to them that I can see my stroller and car seat bag sitting there but no one has brought these up to me. After 15 more min of waiting, eventually the ticket agent at the gate came and unlocked the door and retrieved my stroller for me. This was upsetting to me and my children but I can tolerate this error. I only start by telling this story to show you how truly ridiculous the next part of my travel became. I was set to travel home on flight AA 1202 out of DFW on May 27. At check-in, the ticket agent demanded to see my stroller. I kindly rolled my Baby Jogger double stroller into her view. Mind you, this is the exact same stroller that I travelled with on American Airlines just 2 days prior. She rudely said, \"you can't travel with that.\" I asked why. And she stated, that it is American Airlines policy that you can't travel with a stroller over 20 lbs. I then unloaded my children from the stroller and showed the agent as I broke it down into its 3 parts. The base weighed 22 lbs. She forced me to carry 2 children and usher a screaming 4 year old through the DFW airport over 2 lbs. I will never fly American Airlines again. The Baby Jogger double stroller is one of the most popular travel stroller for families. I have flown with this stroller 20+ times including international and never had an incident like this.

It is absolutely mind-blowing to me that every single time I fly with American, there is some type of issue with the aircraft causing a delay. Every. Single. Time.My personal favorite? When the plumbing blew out of my flight from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, the entire plane began to smell like sewage and we we forced to make an emergency landing in Dallas where we were kept on the overheating smelly plane for over two hours until the staff was legally forced to let us off. I actually cannot even begin to describe how horrific the smell that we endured was. Imagine the smell of NYC sewage in the summer, and imagine that smell is entirely contained within an aircraft in the Dallas heat for two hours. After finally being freed from the aircraft (which we would not have been had it not been illegal for them to contain us any longer), passengers then waited inside DFW for an additional hour until a new plane arrived, at which point we were yelled at by flight attendants that if we did not board quickly enough the flight would not be taking off that night (keep in mind, it was already about 3am Dallas time and the plane was supposed to have landed in LA over an hour before). During this whole situation, American reported to those who called the airline inquiring about the flight's status that it was going to be on time with no delay. Obviously this story is an outrageous outlier, but I fly with American quite frequently at this point and I have seriously NEVER been on a flight where there is not a delay due to something being wrong with the aircraft. It doesn't even matter what route you're taking, what type of plane you're in, nothing. There WILL be a delay. This is not only very frustrating as a passenger, but it's also extremely concerning that literally every single one of their aircrafts has something wrong with it. At this point, I actually find it kind of comical how poorly this airline operates. Last time I flew with American, my flight that was originally \"on time\" ended up being SIX HOURS delayed because something was wrong with the plane and they didn't detect it until boarding began. I'm actually currently on a flight that had its AC break somehow, and after an hour and a half of sitting at the gate, we have just finally received the paperwork and are about to begin taxiing. Also, bonus: if you aren't a first class passenger, expect the flight attendants to treat you like a dead animal on the side of the road, maybe even worse. They genuinely could not care less about you. I fly first class quite often and they're usually tolerable there, but when you're in coach it's awful. Flying is unpleasant enough, especially when you're flying AA, so rude flight attendants that give you attitude and roll their eyes at you really don't work to make the experience better. Long story short: make sure you book your flight to arrive a few hours before you actually need to, because there's little to no chance that you will get to your destination on time or even within an hour of its scheduled arrival. During your flight, which is sure to be hours longer than expected, be ready to be treated like trash.

Unfortunately AA is not the caliber of airline it probably was in years past. I typically fly Delta with great success however on certain flights I've used US Air (now AA) but this last experience was such a cluster that I felt it warranted a review. On our outbound flight from DFW to Colorado Springs our flight was continually delayed as well as with each delay the gates seemed to move as well - at one point it got so ridiculous it became comical. Our departure out of DFW had officially past our originally arrival time in COS. Regardless we rolled with it because hey we're on vacay and not worth letting it impact our mood. (Keep in mind this delay was not impacted by weather - not sure what the issue was here and they didn't seem to want to explain)On our return flight out of COS to DFW the flight was cancelled around 3pm for a 4:38 departure. But it gets better from here. We just happened to be first in line to check our bag when the cancellation announcement was made...we thought ok at least were in line already. We step up to the counter and tell the young lady we realize she's not responsible and we appreciate anything she can do to help us. First offer was best they could do was get us out on. Monday flight (it was Saturday) bc all their flights on Sunday we're booker. After several concerning questions I got her to agree to explore putting us on another carrier - our options United or Delta. We asked for Delta based on their hub locations and our final destination. Then we were told nothing available. We thought we had seats on a United flight out the next day but still exploring same day departure options we stopped at the Delta counter to see what flights they had - they had options out that evening as well as next day. We went back to American counter spoke to supervisor (with flight info from the Delta rep) and he said he could get us on that flight - he assured us all was good and cancelled our \"seat\" on United. This is where it got ridiculous - we took our voucher to Delta only to find AA rep never fully finished the booking and we in fact weren't confirmed and now the seats in United were gone as well. We went back and forth between counters - each only to find the AA reps were not completing the process to truly get their client booked on another carrier and the other carrier flights were now selling out. One AA passenger ended up going to Delta and paying a higher rate to hurry and guarantee her a seat in hopes AA would make it right. This went on and on and on with multiple passengers. Hours later now all flights out of COS Saturday and Sunday were gone and we were then told our only option was to shuttle from COS to Denver at $50 per person, rent a hotel room and get to airport Sunday morning (unconfirmed seats on Delta) and pray we make it home. Thankfully the ticket and gate agents with Delta were empathetic and worked hard to make sure they got us on. I was told at the airport they couldn't compensate us for any of our out of picket expenses we wouldn't have to call AA - which I did only for the guy on the other end to be completely rude and inform me I should had taken that up with the folks at the airport and if they told me to call them they then lied.

On our most recent trip our flight on Tuesday Sep. 3 was canceled due to the hurricane back home in Florida. They let us pick which flight back and only had one Thursday with a layover. My boyfriends sister was flying back to Miami the same day which did not get canceled. That night we called American to get on that flight back so we could just drive home and not be stuck in LA for three extra days. The lady on the phone named crystal told my boyfriend that we can't change our flight to land into another city because we bought our tickets using the points from our AAdvantage card? ... okay what?! What ever.... that night we booked two extra nights on a hotel that was over 100$ a night because we were going to be stuck here. The next morning I got a notification letting me know there are two extra flights available to take Tuesday morning that would land us in Melbourne Florida and NOT ORLANDO.. which didn't make any sense considering the worker said there are no flights for us besides Orlando. We call in the morning again to see about getting on the flight to Miami yet again and the lady on that phone said we COULD DO IT. So she put us on that flight so we could get home that day. We did not have enough clothes or even money to be able to spend two and a half extra days in LA between the hotel, rental car, gas etc. Of course the hotel was non refundable and we had to argue with them to get our money back. BUT all of this could have been avoided if the employees knew what the hell they were doing. So we get to the airport Tuesday morning to head on the Miami flight which the app told us that we had to go to a counter to check in. So of course the workers holding the line up asks us what we are doing which we show them the phone and they go \"well did you try the kiosk\" I said \"no because it says right here we have to check in with a person and not online. So of course he said to go wait in that line to see.... after 10 minutes of waiting I get to the kiosk to just get told by the machine to check in with the counter. So we go to the counter desk and a huge line that we waiting in for 40 damn minutes.... after getting to someone they clearly didn't know what they were doing because two employees just shoved us off to the next employee... some guy named Marvin in the Miami airport counter just clocked in and two employees just told him to figure it out.

I'm writing to tell you about the absolute worst customer service experience I have ever had with an airline company which happened to me, with American Airlines, today!Today I left my house at 5am to be at the miami airport for a 6:55am flight. I am a professional dancer and had to be in Columbus with my fiance for a business meeting as we are small business owners. We had two business meetings and were working all weekend-- one meeting was about another company buying our business! We missed one today, and a gala show that we paid for, due to the terrible service that we received.When I arrived for my first flight I was told I would need to check my bag at the gate due to a full flight. I acquiesced as I understand you have a limited amount of space, even though 90% of the things I needed for my trip were in that carryon. I was not given the chance to offload some things I would need from the bag as my gate attendant insisted we did not have time. I had an otherwise uneventful flight and when I turned my phone back on after we had landed in Philadelphia for our layover, I received a text stating that my original connecting flight taking me to Columbus had been cancelled, and I was rebooked on a flight for the following morning. I went to customer assistance, who was able to book us on standby for a flight at 3:30pm and assured us we were 3rd and 4th in line for standby. At this point, although we were originally supposed to land in Columbus prior to 3pm, we were fine with this, I booked the flights early in case of emergencies and we went about our day. I tried to call customer service, only to be told that American Airlines does not have a customer service department I could call and I would have to email them and wait for a response.When we returned to the gate for standby at 3:30pm we had been moved to 9th and 10th in line (although at 10:30am when we spoke with customer assistance we were numbers 3 and 4). When we asked the gate attendant why, she told us that some passengers had \"status.\"We missed this standby flight, of course, and we were assured by customer assistance we could be rolled over to the next standby flight at 5:30pm. At 5:30pm this flight was delayed as there were not crew available and we waited at the gate for almost 2 hours. Close to 7pm, we were approached by a gate attendant who told us she had one seat for us and if she could find another, we would be on this flight. I watched her receive incorrect information from flight staff and take three people after me in line (who had all mentioned they were standby in this conversation) and who were listed on the board, and my fiance witnessed her adjust seat assignments.When I went back to customer assistance, as my fourth flight of this leg of the trip was delayed until nearly 10:30pm, I asked to be placed on another airline, as my day starts tomorrow at 4:30am. The customer service attendant tried everything in her power to help me and was very kind and understanding. I cannot stress enough how hard she tried to help me. However, this was out of her hands and she referred me to her manager at this point.Her manager was initially pleasant but eventually became frustrated and blamed me for not bringing this to her attention earlier in the day (as she said there was nothing she could do now). I asked if I should have done something other than speak with Customer Assistance, to which she stated no, and then when I was able to give her the last flight information (4448 out of Philadelphia) she checked the gate attendant's log and insisted that the flight attendant did not take 4 people from standby although I watched it happen. She implied that I was lying and that it was my fault that the airline did not do its' job or bring it to her attention sooner. She also told me that no other major airline carriers had direct flights out of Philadelphia to Columbus \"so late in the evening\" (7:30pm).What?Absolutely disgusting customer treatment.

All the while my wife and I are trying to keep our children from wandering off and curiously exploring the airport. Then I shuffle all the luggage over to the counter and the person there says to me that I have to put the bags there so he can weigh them. As a reminder he's done nothing and I mean absolutely zero work since we arrived in line. After I start loading the luggage on the scale he's looking for luggage tags. Then he asks me if I put the luggage tags on them. Really? \u00a0I'm not an employee of the airline. I just did your job. All you need to do now is find the tag and scan it. It really isn't hidden. So basically if you want to pay lots of money for the plane fare just know that it also includes checking yourself in and tagging all your luggage ... doing what some of their agents are incapable of.

However, it was not a direct flight and had a layover in Dallas (DFW). My husband and I had a 6 am flight going out through LAX on a Thursday morning. We arrived to the proper terminal and tried to walk up to the counter to check in one of our luggage bags and also pay for our pet ($125 each way, be sure to make a pet reservation in advance). We walked up to the counter and this employee was upset that we did not go through the same line to get to where we were standing. So she made me walk all the way around to come right back to where we were originally standing. My husband and our little girl dog just stayed in the same spot (no one else was in line) as she made me walk all the way around back to the same spot. I don't even know what was the whole point of that.Then when I came back, this man at the counter told us that he is currently waiting for his system to boot up so he can't help us. But there was a woman right next to him. He didn't bother to tell us to go to her. So we told her we want to check in. At first she said she couldn't help us and pointed us to walk towards our right. This was even before we even told her what we wanted. My husband told her we want to check in our bag so she said she will help us. Then when I told her that we also need to pay for our pet, she automatically snapped at me with \"one thing at a time\" and then rudely asked if I made a pet reservation in advance. Then eventually we were able to check our bag in and pay and then headed towards TSA. When we eventually boarded the plane, I was soon disappointed with the level of (or lack of) service we received there too. I was incredibly cold and had asked the flight attendant if she could provide me with a blanket. She said she didn't have one. I also had asked another flight attendant for some aspirin because I had a headache (I had some in my carry on bag, but it was in the overhead bin and thought it would be easier to just get it from a flight attendant than to have the person sitting in the aisle get up so I can get to my bag). This flight attendant surprised me and said they don't have any. I have flown with other airlines in the past and have been given blankets and aspirin when requested so I found that hard to believe that they had nothing but figured that because this airline is pretty poor, I guess that is why flight tickets were cheap for a reason.Anyways, when I came back from my trip with American again, the crew on American were from Dallas and they had your typical southern friendly hospitality. They were helpful and provided people with blankets (I didn't need one this time and so I did not request for one) and also with aspirin (the woman behind me requested for some and the flight attendant brought her one without any problems). With this lousy and poor customer service provided, leaving from LAX, I am not surprised to see that the overall rating for this business listing is 1.5 stars (at the time I saw this 1.5 weeks ago and still now).

Met up with other family members there. Here's the info on our flights for reference:Outgoing flight: LAX to CLT #1982 on 5/30/17 connecting to flight 5222. Return flight: 5261 on 6/3/17 connecting to flight 820.What everyone says about the attendants at check in is generally true with maybe one or two exceptions. Most of them are curt and not helpful and honestly we do most of their work these days anyway, right!? The attendants at the gates themselves were fine, but we didn't have any special requests for upgrades and don't generally give attitude either. Most of the time, you get what you give people.The good news is that all flights took off and landed on time...so that's a plus! But the cleanliness of the planes leaves much to be desired! Tray tables were greasy and had some unknown food substance on them (no pictures, my phone was dying so was turned off at this point). Someone left a half full (or half empty depending on your outlook) water bottle crammed into the lady's seat pocket next to me and she had to ask a couple of times for an attendant to remove it because they were busy doing other things at that time. So yeah...clean your planes between flights please. It's just gross to deal with another person's leftovers.That being said, all of our flight attendants were actually very nice and helpful! They dealt with any issues courteously and without attitude. We had no issues with them at all. And in fact the attendants on the return trip from CLT to LAX were actually very funny and friendly. They made conversation with many passengers and actually had some personality! The captains said goodbye to everyone on each flight. No baggage issues at all. I flew United earlier in May and they beat the crap out of my bag!! Never again will I fly that airline.So while most other people here seemed to have bad experiences with the attendants, that wasn't the case for us.

Your representative looked at my tickets and the computer and told me to go sit while she works on it. She would call me. 2. About the time of boarding I went to the same counter when I heard my name called. 3. I spoke with an agent. She asked me \"What do you want?\" (Just like that). I explained to her I heard my name called and you were looking and changing our seats. The agent said \"You did not talk to me\". I replied okay can you find out what is going on? (The Agent was obviously upset and made it clear to me she was upset because I took her out of a personal conversation with 4 other employees all doing nothing but talking about their weekend.) She found my tickets lying on the counter and told me to go sit down again and she would work on it. I told her I would rather wait as my name was called. She offensively insisted that I take a seat while \"She works on it\". Important note here, it has been a long time since I was treated like a child and was told to take a seat. 4. The Agent went back to her conversation and by the time she looked up our information the plane had closed the gate.5. The Agent came over in a panic and rushed us to the next gate attendant, she was at \"B\" and the plane was leaving at \"D\" the next booth over. She handed us our same tickets and obscenely ran us up to gate \"D\" but it was too late. 6. I told the Agent at that time that I just had explained to her they were calling our names. She walked away very rudely saying \"It's not my fault\". I said then whose fault is it? Yes it is your fault. I said this is 100% your fault. She just started to walk away without even an apology.

I have booked flights often (without mistakes) and even had my girlfriend double-check our flight details during the booking process, yet, when I went back a month later, I saw that my flight was scheduled for the 27th rather than the 26th. I called to sort the issue out and spoke with a manager, Eric. Eric assumed the issue was my own human error, and gave me no choice but to cancel and repurchase the flights, costing me $1,504. During this process, I was not informed that the sale would be final, unlike the majority of airlines which allow cancellations within the first 24 hours. When it came time for our flight and I began to check in online, I found that our tickets randomly got canceled. When I spoke to a rep, Ellis, she said that it may have been a glitch in your system and it's not impossible that this glitch also caused the original issue. We were placed on hold while Ellis attempted to resolve the issue, however, in the end, we were never provided with a legitimate flight confirmation via email, and we were given seats we had not selected, even though we chose seats weeks prior. As we were on the call for 37 minutes, we had to start traveling to the airport unsure if we even had a flight to board at all. I checked my bank account, and that cancellation did not show up with any money coming back to me, it just cleared my ticket.When I contacted their support staff on email, their customer relations rep, Scott, basically told me to pound sand and that I will get no compensation for the change in the date nor them somehow cancelling our tickets altogether.

And that her friend would have a seat. So the girl got on and when she came back for her friend she did the same thing and said let's go now! When that girl was number 12 on the wait list and my husband and I were way before her. And there was no way that that flight was full, because there was hardly anyone that got one and the lady was just in a rush to close the flight and did after that girl. So we went up and my husband said we were hoping to get on that flight and she was kind of quiet, so he brought up about the girl how she was way down the wait list. The lady had the audacity to tell us that that girl was a pilot and said she got a crew seat!!! We were right there when she was talking to those girls before the flight! I could not believe it! And the lady of course was so rude and to be honest we were frustrated yes,but that does not give her the right to be rude to not only us, but to other passengers as well. \u00a0We were so disappointed with American Airlines.

I flew from LAX to PVG on a 9:30 a.m. flight December 2017. The flight was booked directly with AA. I couldn't check-in from home, I think because I had to show them my Chinese visa, so I arrived three hours before my flight. \u00a0Check-in went smoothly and so did going through the security checkpoint. I arrived at my seat and was quickly greeted with my option of champagne or a mimosa, and shortly after I was brought mixed nuts and a pair of Bose headphones. Make sure you check the bag of goodies they give you (currently with C.O. Bigelow products) because it contains headphone covers. The amenity kit also has a toothbrush/ paste, ear plugs, eye mask, lip therapy, hand lotion, socks, and tissue.The seat (1L) is very comfortable and can be extended so you can lie flat to sleep. The only issue I found was that every time the person behind me moved, my seat would move and wake me up. I have flown Cathay Pacific and they have a bigger seating area with a cubby next to your seat for easy access to your carry on and I found their seats to be more comfortable. Maybe pick a seat in the 5th row to avoid this? Those seats are not connected to each other back to back but you are close to the galley. Note that there is no separate first class cabin. \u00a0This seat has all the basic perks (TV, blankets, pillow, remote, tray table, etc), and if you want WiFi during your flight, it will cost $19 for the entire flight. The entertainment options were good and offers movies (old and new), music, books, TV shows, etc. There is also an option where you can track where you are in your flight in a map. I found the remote control to be a little confusing and I found myself just using the TV's touch screen to select movies or pause them.I was very happy with the meals, which you can pre-select when you book your flight. There are various drink options included in the menu (both alcohol and non-alcohol). They also have a very nice spread between the two business class cabins for a mid-flight snack.I was very happy with the flight, food, drinks, and the service of the Dreamliner (It is not Cathay Pacific, but it also doesn't come with the Cathay price tag).

Truly amazing how poor customer service American Airlines delivers and still manages to stay in business. My wife and I booked our airfare and honeymoon in January of this year, to be married in October. When we arrived at the airport the night after our wedding we were greeted by really, shady news. Initially our flight from LAX had two layovers, one in Dallas and one in Miami before touching down in St. Lucia. When we checked in our luggage we received a note explaining that we need to see the desk clerk. The clerk explained that with the layovers so close together there isn't a chance that us OR our luggage would arrive in Saint Lucia as planned. Stunned, we asked what the solution was. The young lady clearly never learned about customer service because she quickly blamed us for booking the flights too close together. Without trying to investigate, she would have discovered that American Airlines changed our flights, putting us into this situation. But LUCKY US... we would easily pay the $200 per person charge plus the difference of the plane ticket. Are you JOKING? This is a scam! Horrible sales tactic, followed by any argumentative desk clerk. Finally we dealt with Wasim, who looked closely at our situation, also saw that this issue was the beginning of our honeymoon, and he booked us a direct red eye to Miami. He just might be the last great employee in the company. When we got to Miami I took a closer look at our return flights to ensure no more funny business was happening. The day we were set to leave Saint Lucia, we land in Miami around 7PM and leave at 8AM the NEXT DAY. Talk about inconvenient. When we checked into the resort we called American Airlines right away, again not ideal on our honeymoon. We said we don't want to spend the night in Miami. Actually we were going to continue our honeymoon in Austin. Of course American Airlines did what they do best... listened to the trouble they put us through and offered a change of flights WITH a $200 per person charge plus the difference of the flight cost. YOU MUST BE JOKING! We decided to forfeit any further American Airlines flights after we landed in Miami. Instead we flew Southwest the day after we flew back and had a smooth flight. Meanwhile I have brought this to the attention of \"Customer Service\". After multiple back and forth emails, American Airlines presented my wife and I with two vouchers for $250 each within one year for American Airlines. Normally this would be nice however as I explained, I am DONE with American Airlines. Finished! After telling them we would rather have the compensation in the form of money not credit I received an amazing templated email back with the words...\"While we recognize that you are requesting monetary compensation in place of the vouchers, we must respectfully decline\". At this point, my blood began to boil. This is the exact opposite of customer service. So, the company ruined our travel during our honeymoon but hey! lucky us, we can give them another shot! NOOOOO I would rather walk to any of your destinations that deal with the incompetent and poorly trained employees of American Airlines. Fun fact: Most airplanes are built by the same company, it's the people at the airlines that help build loyalty. American Airlines has consistently been a problem with me and thousands of other passengers.

This would have been a major inconvenience, so my husband called & changed the flight to a connecting flight that would leave from JFK @ 3 pm & arrive in Charlotte, NC @ 5:16 pm.

To make matters even worse, 30 minutes before boarding our flight to Charlotte, we found out an additional delay had been added. We were now leaving from Charlotte at 9:10 pm and would not arrive in Austin until midnight. This posed a huge inconvenience as we truly needed to be home at an earlier time due to a family crisis.

Because we were already getting to Austin @ midnight because of the delay, we decided to stand in line and inquire about the vouchers, but were unsure how it would work being that our flight was a connecting one. The employee working at the gate was extremely rude and would not even allow me to inquire about the overbooked flight before turning me away.

Other options included flying to the Northeast and then to Florida, yes, lets spend 2 days of my life to get home on a flight that should be done in a few hours. Interestly, they KNEW before walking into the airport that I had no chance to make the connection, which was pre-determined in their system when the flight was booked! \u00a0Next we had a spirited conversation with multiple levels of 'managers' who felt American Airlines should compensate a hotel and meal. Yet, because it was coded as weather-related, think pre take off, the expense would be mine. Seriosuly? No options were given prior to take off at Vail as to re- booking another day. I spent a scant few hours at a flea bag motel at my expense before returning to DWF airport with no dinner due to the process, my exhaustion, and the late hour.

I feel that your company has been deceived me for $ 1,047, and I feel very bad about that. I feel fooled. The $ 1047 is a huge sum for me.Let me tell you from the beginning, I am still in a terrible shock that occurred two weeks ago to me and my two children at San Francisco airport. Last two week, my two sons came to the airport with a ticket that their father had bought for them to make a summer vacation with their father in Prague, But Delta's flight did not allow to board my little child. They said this is their law and the seven-year-old cannot travel with a teenager of sixteen. They did not mention it before when the father bought the ticket. My sons had to go to New York by Delta flight and then fly from there to Prague. My time was very small. I thought with my credit card I buy a ticket from your company to perhaps arrive in New York on time for their plane to Prague.The elderly lady who was your agency at the first told me to pay $ 25 to find out if there is a ticket. Twenty-five dollars for two minutes to search the internet !!!! I had to admit. she later sold me two tickets to New York for $ 923. She did not explain the fact that they do not accept my children's suitcases. She did not explain her policy about our suitcases. Surely if she explained the policy, I would never buy that tickets. Naturally, when International Fly is conducted for two months of the summer, anyone has personal belonging and cannot travel without it and she could see us with suitcases. We rushed to the gate quickly, Your colleagues at the American Airline asked me to charge a Ready CARD with a hundred dollars to the device in front of the gate for my bags. I entered another one hundred dollars and bought a card. but as we insisted, the flight agents refused to take delivery of the children's luggage. We quickly returned to the airline office, and the whole process did not last for thirty minutes. We explained that they did not ride us. But she finally calmly said she was not responsible for this problem, and we should be careful about ourselves. How could we have been careful 20 minutes before a flight or know their rules when she didn't explain? At the same time, when we were running in the hallways of the airport, I lost my wallet with bank cards and all my cash and Ready CARD too. At the very moment and half an hour after buying my ticket, I called the bank and asked to return my money, because that lady easily deceived me. But the bank said it was not able to stop paying the money because it was irreversible. For me, being a single mother, a thousand dollars is a significant sum.Do you think this is fair? That I too will be deceived, waste my time, I'm getting stressed up and I must work hard to pay that amount? I'm going to follow this problem because this is in my life like earthquakes.

We arrived at San Francisco airport in cargo to pick up our loving six-month-old Portuguese water dog (Buddy) and waited until midnight to find out our dog didn't arrive. \u00a0 Our hearts were broken! \u00a0No one seemed to have answers to why Buddy didn't arrive. \u00a0We called the 800 number and was told that our dog was sent to the wrong airport. \u00a0I am not sure why no one called us to let us know that our dog wouldn't be arriving. \u00a0We drove an hour from our house to San Francisco airport. Buddy was scheduled to leave Texas and arrive in San Francisco but didn't. \u00a0Your employees answering the customer support informed at midnight that our dog was sent to the wrong airport and we had two options to get our dog: #1 Option Buddy would have to fly to Texas and then fly back to San Francisco#2 Option \u00a0Buddy would need to fly to Santa Ana airport (California) to Chicago and then to SFOIt's absolutely horrible that you treated our dog like a piece of luggage. \u00a0Our dog was on a flight since 2 pm (EST). \u00a0We talked with numerous customer success associates and was told they couldn't do anything because there was no supervisor on duty. \u00a0Airlines operate twenty-four hours a day and should have a supervisor that can make decisions and triage situations like this when they arise. \u00a0We were told that a supervisor would call when they came on duty at 5 am (PST). \u00a0Of course, no one called and we called back and finally reached a supervisor. \u00a0They again told us they were going to ship the dog back to Chicago and then fly him to San Francisco. \u00a0We already researched a flight from LAX and demanded that the drive the dog from Santa Ana airport to arrive at LAX and then flown to SF. \u00a0They didn't agree but finally approved it. \u00a0Our dog finally arrived 18 hours after he flew out of St Louis to San Francisco. \u00a0Buddy was terrified. \u00a0He wouldn't come out of the kennel. \u00a0I finally got him out of his kennel and put a collar on him and took him out of his kennel. \u00a0I let him go to the bathroom outside the cargo area at American Airlines and he got out of his collar terrified and took off running. \u00a0He ran miles into the wetlands near San Francisco airport. \u00a0I ran after him to try and save him but caught in the mud. \u00a0I called 911 and three fire airport engines, K-9 unit, and airboat helped save Buddy and myself from the wetlands and mud I was stuck in. \u00a0Our dog left his breeder as a confident loving dog and now is traumatized. \u00a0 It's absolutely unacceptable how our dog was treated on your airline. \u00a0We now need to help hire a trainer to build his confidence again. \u00a0You should learn from our story and treat animals humanely. \u00a0#youshouldlearnfromunited #dogsarenotluggages#behumanetoanimalsamericanairlines"}, {"count": 1298, "date": "1/4/2019", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "If I could rate American Airlines ZERO I would.

The incoming flight from ORD to MCI had to be rerouted up to MN and down to Kansas to avoid the storm --totally understandable! Though it's worth mentioning that AA ticketing staff mentioned they asked AA to cancel the flight so that passengers could get hotels & relax, and AA employees could end their shifts. I only ended up at the ticketing counter because the AA website was down & wouldn't allow me to pull up my boarding pass for TSA to scan.Plane arrives after several delays and changes. What was once 7:14 p.m. became 11:15 p.m. (again: I get it). The plane is too small for passengers to carry on ANY luggage so tags are handed out and bags are checked at the gate. Board the plane and proceed to seat 1A. 11:15 p.m. turns into 11:50 p.m. Which would be fine, except I paid for first class and the flight attendant hasn't even acknowledged me after 35 minutes. No offer of water, blanket (or anything) before take-off. I had to ask for a blanket because it was freezing cold. Her? \"I dunno.\" Walks away and comes back with a ripped open blanket bag that she tosses onto my lap without a word.Lights are turned off for take-off. First class flight attendant is preoccupied texting and staring at her screen, while simultaneously holding a cabin drawer - that she didn't get a chance to secure because she was too busy gabbing & texting - to avoid it breaking loose and slamming into a wall. She waited until the very last second to stop texting and secure the cabin & buckle in...At this point it's after 1:00 a.m. Lights are off, save the individual lights passengers chose to turn on. One walk through by the flight attendants (one in first class and one in the main cabin). Short flight so it's likely they aren't required to do more than one walk through; even so, they were rushed & unfriendly -- propelled forward only by their desire to meet in the first class galley to gossip. They proceeded to talk and laugh loudly. I had noise cancelling headphones on and could hear their conversation pretty clearly. Curtains are open, lights in the galley are on and they're discussing how one isn't confident about how she reads her take-off script and always screws it up (yup!) and whatever is on the phone screen they're staring at. Meanwhile everyone is trying to SLEEP, and the only thing preventing this from happening is THEM. The above CONTINUES for the duration of the flight. Plane lands. We're about to depart and the gate employees ask how many passengers are on the plane. The first class flight attendant has NO IDEA and says \"I dunno...dunno. I dunno, maybe 46...or 48? somewhere around there.\" Mkay...Despite what was likely only a 10 year age gap between myself and the flight attendants, I couldn't help but think: WHERE IS THE ADULT ON THIS FLIGHT?! WHO IS ENSURING THESE CHILDREN ARE DOING THEIR JOBS? There was a time that I'd get on a flight and the flight attendants (regardless of which cabin they were in) would acknowledge the passengers. I have never - not even once - been on a flight where I had to listen to entire conversations and complaints by the flight attendants. After an almost 5 hour delayed flight...? Certainly not the level of awareness and understanding I was expecting from AA employees.Oh, and when I walked off the plane to wait for my bag? I waited until the last 4 passengers were standing there to get my bag. Not the end of the world, but I paid for first class (which I'm rarely able to do), couldn't store my bag in my cabin, didn't get any attention from the flight attendant, was forced to stay awake because I couldn't manage to drown out the flight attendants' chatter, NO goodbyes and then...mine was one of the last bags to make it out (never mind the yellow tag distinction).Garbage. NEVER AGAIN. The only reason I'm giving this review 2 stars instead of 1, is because the cockpit crew provided updates in a very understanding & sympathetic manner. After all, they were likely in the same position as the passengers...just wanting to go home to their families; and yet they managed a kindness that was beyond the children in 'charge' of keeping the passengers content and comfortable. Clearly they lack ANY kind of work ethic and social skills. Just a job. For the LOVE OF GOD: please put an ADULT on EVERY plane that isn't concerned with her phone, gossiping & personal agenda! BTW: EVERY passenger was aware that a couple on the flight was on only there as a result of a family loss...except the flight attendants. Passengers conveyed their condolences because they heard it verbalized at the gate. There was evidently no communication between the gate staff and the flight staff...or perhaps, just like every other detail: the flight attendants simply couldn't manage the burden of acknowledging anyone/anything other than one another & their phones."}, {"count": 1338, "date": "5/6/2018", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "Took American Airlines again for a short 1.5 hour flight.

So now we are boarding flight AA2398 and it was delayed because of weather and we understood that. Everyone is on the plane we push off from the gate and start to taxi to take off. While we were in line the pilot had to pull off because he got word from the tower that he would be over on his hours but he was going to try and get a shorter route to get us home. He then said flight attendants prepare for take off and everyone cheered. However, he came back on and said he couldn't go and he was going back to the gate and that we would have to stay over night. He told us to go to special services and they would give us a voucher for a hotel and we would be rebooked tomorrow. Now we are in line, and we find out that in fact we were not going to get a hotel voucher because the cancellation was due to weather which is not correct it was due to pilot hours. The special service gave everyone a new boarding pass for today (6/23/18) at 9am. He said to go trough security and that we would be flying out in the morning and to trust him he will get us home.

I didn't see it on the screen so I went to an American Airline agent and he double checked and he said yes we are still all set for 9am and gate 36. \u00a0About 6:30am I overheard another passenger tell her friend that our flight was cancelled I told him that the ticket agent and pointed to the one I talked too said it was not. The passenger double checked and the ticket agent said that flight was cancelled. I asked the ticket agent why he told me it was still on time prior and he said that he just went off the info I gave him. (Which I gave him the flight number)Now I went to the special service agent and stood there cause the sign said it was open and when another ticket agent walked by I asked if he could help me and he told me no he had to go to a gate and lead me to the first class place. The first class place told me he couldn't help me. Since no one helped me I finally just called American Airlines and they lady I spoke to told me I was on a flight and I would be home at 5:15pm.

When we arrive at our destination overseas, the lock is no longer on my bag. Very suspicious so I open the bag and check contents to find that not only was the lock CUT off of my bag illegally, I had a $150 electric razor stolen, a $350 watch, and $500 in cash for spending money stolen along with smaller items. How does this even happen? Who are you putting into a position to steal from me? Why is the airline hiring criminals to handle my luggage which I paid for in confidence that it would be taken care of? I am in another country so I cannot immediately contact anyone via telephone so I fill out a complaint online. To my surprise I actually got a response but unfortunately the response asked me to provide a laundry list of impossible tasks. Receipts for all items stolen, copy of this copy of that, etc. Look I get it, these things happen it's not the end of the world and I will provide what I can that they ask but I know it's not going to be enough. All I was asking for was it to be taken care of properly by the Airline. Instead I get the response of them basically denying responsibility, and if I cannot give the information requested I am still out my $1700 for the ticket and over $1000 of personal affects that were stolen. How can a company call themselves honest and good when they refuse to take responsibility for their illegal actions? I will NEVER fly with them again, NEVER recommend them to any other person, and ALWAYS write a horrible review every opportunity I get until they are able to right their wrong. Again, I do not expect the airline to do anything about this at all because it is already apparent they do not care right off the bat by putting a criminal in place to cut locks off bags and go through their personal affects and take what they please. Good luck to ANYONE trying to fly with American because even if you think your bag is safe and locked, they wont hesitate to cut it right off and steal from you. Thanks for the WORST flight experience I have ever had American Airlines. I wont ever expect anything more from you.

I approached a rep standing at the self check-in, and she proceeded to ignore me. Finally, when I was the only traveler standing in her area, she pointed at the kiosk. Yes, that was the extent of her instruction.

Unfortunately, we had to spend 3 hours with the most unhappy American Airlines employee I've encountered in almost a decade. \u00a0She was the first class flight attendant from DFW - LAX on 2.23.16, flight #2489. \u00a0Medium length dirty blonde hair, probably early 50's. \u00a0She was just plain sassy. \u00a0My spouse ordered a pre-flight drink. \u00a0When she brought it to him, he was on his iPad and didn't hear her say \"Ginger ale?\" twice. \u00a0She then though it was better to say \"HELLO?!\" \u00a0Mind you, the cabin is bustling with chatter and people waiting in the aisles to head to the back of the plane. \u00a0How about a simple \"Sir, I have your ginger ale?\" \u00a0Nope, attitude is better. \u00a0That was instance #1. \u00a0Part 2 happened not too long after, when she was reconfirming our lunch orders. \u00a0My spouse pre-selected our meals online, and I have no idea what he selected. \u00a0Sassy comes over, asks me \"I have you both with the chicken cobb salad?\" \u00a0I have no idea what was ordered, so before I could even ask him what he ordered, she stares at me with a blank look on her face, no emotion, and shaking her head side to side while asking \"Is that a yesssss?????\" \u00a0I was so appalled, I didn't say anything as I am past showing anger towards rude people. \u00a0When I deal with people like this, I just stay present and calm, I lose eye contact with them, and just give them very cold body language back. \u00a0Oh yeah, and take it to Yelp. \u00a0Like everyone says, if you're unhappy at your job, leave!Really, people, being rude and sassy these days is not good for business. \u00a0And with the power of Yelp, we can let the world know. \u00a0You have no idea, or if you're a Yelper you really do, how influential this site is.On the positive, because there is always a balance, kudos to the pilot who informed all of us of a slight 15 minute delay due to a missing o-ring in the lavatory. \u00a0Communication is key. \u00a0And, the female flight attendant who relived sassy at one point, kindly asked if we needed anything because we were \"low maintenance.\" \u00a0LOL. \u00a0That's why I refer to us as TRAVELERS, not tourists."}, {"count": 1443, "date": "2/18/2018", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Worst airlines ever just became even more so if that could have been possible.

I'd like to say I'll never fly American again but my husband and I have way too much accrued mileage points with them. I had to change carriers in LA, from Hawaii last week. I think a 2.5 hour layover is decent to get checked in and through TSA again with a dog. It was 10 pm and there were only 3 people in front of me at the customer service line and 3 agents. I thought great I'm going to actually be at my gate early and not have to run there. WRONG! It took those 3 agents about one hour to take care of the 3 people in front of me! This was primarily due to the fact that one agent decided to leave her desk and wander around the check in area and chat with coworkers. A customer behind me was so upset that he went to the employee that was at the start of our line and complained. All she did was shrug that off.After an hour my turn finally came up. The Poor passengers in front of me missed their flight because it took the agents too long to get them checked in, even though they were told by the employee monitoring the line that they would make it.The customer service agent that I got didn't even greet me and proceeded to complain for a good 30 seconds to her coworker about the disabled man that she had to check in prior. Granted this was the same lady that was wandering around the terminal area chatting with random people. The major problem with having this woman check me in was that she did not know much. She pretty much told me within the first five minutes that I could not have my dog with me in cabin, even though I had called and confirmed my dog to be with me in cabin prior to this booking.Once I told her that she said ok she'll process me. \u00a0She then began to rudely interrogate me about the procedures to bring a pet out of the country and to the Bahamas to which I had to correct her that I wasn't leaving the country, St. Thomas is a US territory. I showed her ALL the documents the rep I called at American Airlines requested me to have and she rudely said \" what is this? I have no idea of what this is.\"She told me that it would be $200 however I was quoted $125 by the individual I spoke to, to confirm my in cabin pet, weeks prior. She then went down to the end of the rows of check-in terminals to talk to somebody. That took her 10 minutes and when she returned she insisted the charge was $200 so I pulled up the American airlines website on my phone and showed her that it was $125.She responded that before the charge was $200 and now it's $125, which I was like whatever, just get me checked in. Low and behold after arriving at my destination I was charged not only for the $125 but also for the $200. That shouldn't have surprised me as she had to ask 2 co- workers to help her with the codes to charge me for my dog and kept on saying over and over \"the code is not working!\"The lady then went to the other end of the checkin desk and started rummaging through drawers looking for something. It looked like she didn't find anything because she came back empty-handed and that wasted another 10 minutes.Her coworker after she arrived back started asking her an insane amount of questions to help another customer, to which she then almost took over for him and ignored me.At this point 40 minutes had already passed with her and I asked the lady if I was going to make it to my flight on time to which she responded that she would try to get me processed.....really?!She left again and went down to talk to another coworker at the other end of the area. An hour had elapsed at this point and I found myself running through TSA and to my gate.American Airlines at LAX here's some advice that would have made my experience better. Virgin airlines already does this and I'll be flying with them from now on as much as possible.1) Train your people on your systems, my agent was interrupted 17 times by her co-worker. They both really didn't know of what they were doing.2) Train your people on YOUR procedures.3) Send your people to customer service training.4) have a supervisor available for the agents to get help ( this is not a team checkin thing) and make sure employees are doing their jobs!"}, {"count": 1447, "date": "1/24/2018", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "If I could give someone a 0/10 this would be it!

Smaller seats in the main cabin... isn't there a class actions suit here? Surely someone has had deep vein thrombosis (blood clots) from sitting on one of these torture devices.2. Failure of the self-check-in technology... the kiosks never really seem to work well yet passengers are encouraged to use them despite enormous frustration. 3. Paid seat selection has become a major \"revenue enhancement\" that is an obvious way to extract every penny from every customer for something that was, in the recent past, not a factor. It's extremely irritating. \u00a04. Increasingly onerous fees for carry-ons and checked-in luggage. The person in front of me in line had to pay $100 for a bag that was 7 lbs. overweight. These customer gouging policies just make everyone attempt to put more in their carry-on which delays plane entrance and exit since these oversize bags are hard to get in or out of the overhead bin. 5. Stressed out, low paid staff On this particular trip there was a \"mechanical malfunction\" on the airplane which caused a delayed departure and a missed connection. We were put up in a hotel about 30 minutes from DFW airport. \u00a0The hotel was clearly the lowest bidder with commensurate low quality. In addition, given the distance from the hotel to the airport, incredible traffic, and the \"once every hour\" shuttle schedule, I had to take a cab. I was told that I could get a refund for the cab ride by the AA staff at the check-in area; however, when I actually got to the check-in counter I was told that \"we no longer can issue refunds at the counter... you have to go to AA.com and request a refund.\" Yet another customer unfriendly policy. I did go to the AA web site, followed the instructions, and sent off a letter with all of the receipts and an explanation. I got response by email indicating that I would receive a refund check; HOWEVER, they refused to pay for the tip part of the receipt! This epitomizes the culture of AA management. A customer spends an hour organizing and mailing out a request for a refund and the company finds a reason NOT to pay the full amount... note, the tip was 20%... not out of line. I could go on for pages about this airline's deficiencies... forced credit card tie-ins (use the AA credit card if you want even semi-decent treatment), charges for speaking with anyone on the phone, scheduling connections as low as 30 minutes thereby increasing the likelihood of a problem (but increasing the airline's revenue by schedule compression), 9 different check-in groups, silly separate roped off areas that separate those in higher priced seats (First, Business, groups 1-3), etc. The airline is seemingly run by a bunch of marketers, cost accountants, and financial people. There is no longer a focus on customer satisfaction... just the bottom line. This is a clear sign of the lack of competition... there are really only 4 airlines remaining for the entire U.S. American Airlines is a prime example of happens when antitrust laws are not enforced and \"deregulation\" becomes an excuse to let airlines mistreat passengers to increase their bottom line. It's time to allow foreign airlines to enter the U.S. market. U.S. airlines and passengers need the competition. \u00a0THERE IS NOT A SINGLE U.S. AIRLINE IN THE TOP 30 RANKING OF AIRLINES IN THE WORLD.

We flew my mother in law from Honduras to Virginia, with a connection in MIA. We did everything needed to request her wheel chair service in advance as well as provide an emergency contact number. She checks in, gets wheel chair service to her aircraft. She departs and arrives in Miami for her 2 hour and 34 minute layover. They take her off the plane and to her next gate. Here's where you start to completely fail. There is a gate change and nobody does anything to get the handicap person to her new gate. No, instead, you realize this flight is overbooked and this is an easy \"bump\" to make room. I'll get to the proof of that statement shortly. She realizes after much time she's not leaving MIA on her scheduled flight. Traveling from another country, she has no cell phone to notify anyone. She became upset and crying. Did anyone step in yet? Not American Airlines! Luckily, a passenger say her upset and offered her cell phone for her to make a call. When she got us on the phone, we immediately started calling to find out what happened. The agent on the phone tells us she missed her connecting flight and was rescheduled for the next morning. When asked how or why, we were told she was at a call center and could only ready what was on the screen? Really, that's your customer service? Ok, move on as we now have an issue at hand. We call the courteous traveler back while she is still nearby so we can talk again and try to calm down my mother in law. Starting to ponder if we should start a 16 hour drive, we call another number to American Airlines, I believe at the MIA airport. This person tells us not to worry, they will get her into a hotel as well as transportation to and from. Ok, so now move on to finding out if the bags would arrive on the original flight. This is where the proof comes in that she was purposely bumped to another flight. American could not tell us if the bags were on the original flight or not. We go to the airport and check baggage claim for the original flight. Bags arrive? NO, which tells us they were scheduled for the next day as well. This shows American Airlines had no intention to put her on her scheduled flight because the bags were not transferred to that plane. So, now, where did they take her and is she ok? After all, she is handicap and not able to get around. She came from a foreign country, with no American cash in hand to buy anything. Finally, we track down what hotel they were going to take her to and assured everything would be fine. Then, finally at 3:30am, we are able to speak to my mother in law again. They had literally just put her in a hotel .... AND WITH 3 TOTAL STRANGERS!! Are you kidding me?? Then, have the audacity to tell her she is being picked up at 4:30am in time for her new flight. She is put in this hotel with her carry on, 2 fifty pound checked bags, and her purse. When her shuttle arrives an hour later to take her back to the airport, she is offered no assistance with bags. Now, a handicap person who had wheelchair access requested must now carry 2 fifty pound suitcases, a carry on, and her purse. Again, luck struck as another passenger sees the struggle and starts to help. And lucky for that passenger because the new flight had a gate change as well. Which, now we know, American does nothing to assist with and just let you miss your flight. If anyone could possibly rationalize this into any form of being acceptable, I'd love to hear it!

Unfortunately, during that week, I came down with a severe case of the flu. The day before my flight, I went to an urgent care center. The doctor urged me not to fly the next day due to the highly-contagious nature of the flu virus, as well as my weakened immune system. She warned that I was at a high risk of catching something much more serious if I flew, such as a bacterial infection, suggested that I push back my flight a few days to the point where I was no longer contagious, and sent me home with a note.That night, I spoke to several American Airlines representatives and made a decision: I would not fly to Colorado the next day and would forfeit the value of my ticket, but would try and fly out a few days later so that I could still use my return flight. The representatives made it clear that I would be forfeiting the value of my outbound flight ticket due to it being a Basic Economy ticket, which I begrudgingly accepted. None of the representatives, despite discussing my plans with them, made it clear that I would have trouble with my return flight. So, after spending a few days getting better, I flew out to Colorado several days later with a newly-purchased one way, intending to take my previously-purchased return flight to New York. The evening before my return flight, I attempted to check in, only to find that my reservation had been cancelled. Distraught, tired, still sick, and far from home, I called American Airlines to ask what was going on, only to receive the absolute worst customer service experience I have ever had in my life. The representative had no patience for listening to my situation and confusion. She told me that my return flight had been cancelled when I did not take my outbound flight. When I told her that I had spoken with several representatives about missing my outbound flight and none of them mentioned any consequences to my return flight, she insinuated that I was lying, as all representatives are trained to explain things fully to customers. She then cut me off as I was talking and told me to \"take this as a life lesson\" and would not engage with me further. I have never felt so belittled by a customer service representative before, much less for an illness that was completely out of my control. American Airlines left me stranded 1,700 miles from home with no warning, all because a doctor urged me not to fly lest I endanger myself and everyone who would have been on my outbound flight.

I just kept wondering if I was in some sort of time warp and asking myself, 'Is this what it felt like to be black 60 years ago?'\"Baldwin has said she would like an \"admission of wrongdoing and an apology\" from American Airlines.A spokesperson for American Airlines told The Independent: \"We have reviewed the allegations, and no discrimination occurred. After a flight was cancelled, an agent inadvertently provided two first class seats to Ms Baldwin and Ms Novack. The passengers were not ticketed for the first class cabin, and a formal upgrade was not processed. (i.e. they were never charged/miles were not deducted.)\"The next day, the agent working the flight realized the error, since we were short one seat in the first class cabin. Instead of removing both passengers from first class, we permitted the passenger who was 'upgraded' in error first, to remain in the first class cabin as a gesture of goodwill. Ms. Novack was the passenger who was upgraded in error first.\"We have apologized to both passengers for the confusion, and explained how the issue occurred - which was an error on our part.\"This isn't the first time American Airlines has come under fire for flight attendants' behaviour.

I even asked the manager if he could eat 3 square meals by himself off of $12 and he told me no, yet they wanted 2 people to share $12 for 4 meals. We get on the plane from Charlotte-Chicago and you never would've guessed, but we had the rudest and most snootiest flight attendants of the whole trip. We then land in Chicago and head to our gate (after I stop and puke because we have been up for about 28+ hours at this point with no food) to try and find out our seats. By this point you can probably guess how we were treated. The woman at the counter would not even lift her eyes from her computer to acknowledge me. They start to call groups to board the plane and we still don't know, so for the 4th time we go up, she tries to dismiss us and we didn't allow it. We explained that one of us is epileptic and that we have not slept or eaten and we just wanted to make sure we were going to make this flight. It was at that moment that another front desk woman took our tickets because the other woman would not acknowledge us or give us the time of day. We then get seats that are separated, but we finally make it to Denver at around 1:30 pm. This is the worse airline service I have ever been on and I talked with multiple people that fly consistently and they had never heard of anything like this. We lost 2 days of pay and we were up for over 30 hours with no sleep and $12 for 2 people to eat. They do not care about there customers and once they have your money they will screw you and treat you like trash. The Charlotte branch is extremely racist and I will never step foot in that airport again. I will never fly American Airlines again and I will make sure I let as many people know about our experience and how we were treated!!

I asked customer service how much it would cost to purchase 5k, and they said it would be $180. The exact same flight with no points costs $145. Why would I pay more money to use my points? It's a rip-off.I was going to just purchase the flight without the points, but then I realized I don't even want to accumulate points or fly on American if their points are 100% worthless.AA doesn't care to make any changes, either. \u00a0Here is what American Airlines emailed me after I complained about the worthless rewards program, calling their rewards program \"very\" popular:Dear ___:Thank you for contacting AAdvantage\u00ae Customer Service.We understand your objection to the transaction charge for buying AAdvantage\u00ae miles. Nevertheless, the opportunities we offer members to buy miles, give miles as gifts and share miles have proven to be very popular. These programs help members bridge the gap in order to obtain travel rewards more quickly. The cost to buy miles reflects the value of those miles, which otherwise would have been acquired through one or more mileage-earning transactions. The additional transaction charge covers the administrative cost of the mileage purchase.There are alternatives to buying miles, since it's easy to earn miles on your own. Please visit our website at aa.com/earn to see how quickly your miles can add up.Thank you for giving me the opportunity to respond.

I have been flying for over 30 years, all over the place. I have never had such a horrible experience as I did today. Now first let me tell you, I have never missed a flight in my life. I got to the airport 1.5 hours ahead of departure. Lax (I know it's not the fault of American Airlines) closed the departing lane in the airport, it took 50 mins to just get to the terminal. When I walked in, total madness and mayhem. Lines everywhere no clue where to go or what line to get into. Went to a Kiosk to get my boarding passes ( p.s. I always get my boarding passes the night before to prevent this from happening, and to pay for my bag ahead of time so I can drop and go, but I was not able to do that because \" no seats were available\" so I could not do any of my preflight boarding passes) The kiosk was right next to a bag scale and I put my one checked bag on the scale and went through the prompts and no option came up for bag check. I had my boarding passes and was confused. I went up to a staff member and asked for assistance, she pointed to the other side of the terminal and told me to go \" there\" to the kiosk that you could check bags in with. So I stood on that line for 20 mins and got up to the kiosk and it read I was already \"checked in\" so I could not use it I had to go to yet another line, so I did and waited there 25-30 mins and when I got to the counter I was told that I had to pay $125.00 for my bag because it's over weight 12 pounds. Really?!?!? So I am trying to keep things simple and check a bag that I already have to pay for and I could have checked 2 bags and paid 50.00 total even though it's the same weight. I think that is totally stupid. \u00a0So I told her that is outrageous, she said well that's the price take it or leave it. I was like I guess I have to take it, she was like well, handing me back my boarding passes said, \"this flight has started to board you can't check the bag, you missed your flight.\" I was like, \"what?\" I have been in lines for an hour trying to get this bag checked and now I missed my fight when it's not due to leave for 30 mins? She with a huge attitude said, \" yep\".So, I have to go to another line and stand and wait for 40 more mins and am told if I want to be on the next flight guaranteed I have to pay $75.00 per person so that would be $225.00 if I don't pay then I have to go on stand by and may or may not have a seat. Wow, ok. He is the crazy part, the $125.00 for the bag I have to 4:00 o'clock to tell them I am not going and the boarding happens at 5:30 so my bag will be sent to the place I am going if I don't go and it has to come back and I have to pick it up from the airport and that is 4 hours from where I live. This is just crazy!My rental car place is only open to midnight and if I do end up on the next flight, I will get there after they are closed. It will cost me more money to get a car from a place that is open 24/7 and it will take longer.So I am at the airport awaiting my fate.I remember the days when travel was fun and people cared and treated you like a paying customer. Now, you are less then dog sh**. I think animals get treated better. I think the bigger ideal here is greed, it's all about nickel and dime you to death.

We then did some more research and saw that the CDC had a red alert for puerto rico and they too advised pregnant mothers not to travel to puerto rico. Our tickets were non-refundable, but we reached out to American airlines ahead of our flight dates with a doctors note and information from the CDC website. First off, you cannot reach customer relations by phone only through email. Even with all the information and doctors note, our request for a refund was denied. We understood, since the tickets were non-refundable, so we asked to be able to use them towards a different flight. some time had passed and we didn't receive an email back so we called and finally my husband spoke to an employee that looked into our situation and said that we would be able to apply a portion of each ticket toads a different flight. Being as this was our first pregnancy we asked how long we had to use the tickets. So, we had paid one thousand for our original flights and now had a credit of $500 to apply towards other flights with an expiration date of June 2018. Sadly, our daughter is now 6 months old and we were so excited to book a first family trip and a mini vacation from being first time parents, we called in on March 16, 2018 to look for flights and was told that our tickets had EXPIRED AS OF MARCH 3, 2018!

The only thing she gave us was a leftover entree only from the business class cabin. When I thanked her for this, she responded with \"yeah ok\". Gee, thanks for the hospitality! Another FA later lectured me for going to back galley to get water because they were too lazy to fill the middle galley water for over 2 hours.

We were leaving Friday evening and planning on returning on Sunday. We were five minutes out from the airport when we received a text letting us know that the flight was canceled. Not because of bad weather but because of maintenance. After a terrible call to your help line where they were rude and informed me they could not do anything for me, I went to get in line at the airport kiosk to speak to someone in person since I was already there and had already spent $75 on my Uber to get there. That is when I discover the true dysfunction. They had no idea what was going on, and the line to speak to anyone took an hour and a half. They had people that were supposed to be working just standing around chatting with each other with a huge line waiting. Each person that came up to the kiosk took around a half hour to get moving. Ive never seen more frustrated people in one place. Not just because of the flight to Charlotte, but because of a number of different flights. The girl next to me was literally in tears because they had lost her reservation back to Greece (which they eventually made right after acting like there was nothing they could do). The person behind me going to Vegas was denied a boarding pass to Vegas because he showed up 59 minutes before to get his boarding pass. One man was sitting down on the kiosk on the phone himself for over an hour trying to get rescheduled himself after you employees gave him the phone because they couldnt handle the probelm, he felt so bad that he went around and apologized to everyone after and certainly was criticizing American Airlines. By the time I finally got to the front of the line, the woman I was dealing with told me she couldn't get me on another flight that day and couldn't refund my ticket. I had to go online. Its absurd they don't give their employees the ability to help customers in real time. I don't know what CRM they use, but everyone of their employees acts helpless and useless. I called customer service again while at the airport and they said they couldn't refund me and also pointed me towards the websiteI finally had to take an Uber back at my own expense again, I didn't receive a refund for my ticket, I didn't get reschedule on a flight same night so I had to cancel my trip all together. When I finally get home and try to get a refund on my ticket your site tells me I am not eligible. The fact that I had to call the help line again was absurd. Finally they issued the refund over the phone. Why their customer service rep at the airport couldn't do that I don't know. The refund finally came back and obviously didn't include taxes and your processing fees so I am out another $100 approximately. So when all is said and done they canceled my trip for no reason and could not reschedule me. I am out hundreds of dollars in out of pocket expenses. They wasted hours of my time.

This time, due to a number of reasons, I had to opt out with flying American Airlines on the way back to Seattle from Philadelphia and it was the worst travel experience I had in years.It started in Philadelphia already: the flight was overbooked, of course. The plane was old, but my seats were okay because I paid extra for \"preferred seats\" and sat in the front area. Once sitting on the plane, it turns out that apparently there is an issue with their A/C or airpressure control. At first we are being told \"few minutes\" and that engineers will take care of it, \"mostly paperwork\". 15-20 min later, this was extended to the full diagnosis and to \"30 min, at best\". After over an hour we were told this may take up to 2 hours and another 10 mins later finally asked to deplane. Mind you: I had a connection flight in Chicago following a layover of just over 2 hours - which obviously meant that connection was no more.After talking to the gate agent (she was cool, staff here did their best with what was not their fault)\u00a0I was put on a new connection, from Philly to Charlotte and then to Seattle. Of course, my careful seat selection that I did during booking was all gone. The plane i then got onto was an old machine, seats old and cramped so tighly together, i couldn't even sit straight without bruising my knees. Old chairs, uncomfortable and everything so horribly closely cramped together, I could not reach anywhere once the table was unfolded. Also, of course I sat in the very back, center seat, all of which was the exact opposite of what I had previously paid money for so that I would not have to endure it. Mostly because I am very tall (and thus, need space) and because I had a connection that I didn't want to jeopardize by having to try to get out of the very back of a plane on time.Suffice to say: this flight again was delayed, over half an hour. The flight really sucked, it was tight, no wifi, no way to charge phone or other electronics.Finally in Charlotte, off to the next flight: pretty much the same thing, except that this one at least had wifi. However, since AA does like to overbook their flights they now collected my carry on because all overheads were full, although I told them I was already late and needed to run once we arrive in Seattle and didn'd have time to wait at the baggage claim. To no avail, customers needs don't matter. And of course it left delayed! Seriously?! And again, with no explanation whatsoever.Finally in Seattle, I joked to my ride that they can take their time because deducted from today's experience it is safe to assume that it will take quite a while until I get my luggage. And guess what: we landed at 8.42 and the baggage claim carousel started(!) running at 9.21. Nearly 40 minutes!!! Until I finally had my carry-on back it was past 9.30, altogether almost an hour to get my stuff! Are they kidding me? With Alaska you get a free flight if it takes more than 15 minutes! But hey, they also have newer planes, fewer delays (never experienced such a thing with them), wifi and charging options in their planes and leg room!Funny note: just two weeks earlier nearly the same thing happened to my GF when flying AA from Philly: delay, technical issue, flight crew getting over service time limit, deplane, massive delay.

I fly a lot for both work and leisure; due to this fact I am unable to always stick with one particular airline due their routes, so frequent flier programs don't particularly work for me; I try to go with the most efficient route, least amount of lay overs and as well most of us are searching for; the best price. Due to this particular trip which was booked two years in advance and airlines do not allow for purchase that far in advance; that being said American Airlines had the best price and the most direct flight. One would think that would be a good thing, well in this case it did not. If you have ever heard the expression \"you get what you pay for\" this is true of American Airlines. Sadly I had round trip airfare for this airline and the return flight was far worse than the initial flight. Upon arriving to the airport there was severe congestion getting into LAX for AA; the lines were practically out the door, so much so that curbside check was the most efficient and I must add this was the only AA staff member that actually gave a damn, everyone else gave the impression that you could go to hell. Needless to say, curbside told me that my flight was leaving from the adjacent building which was odd. I had to trek clear across another building. Flight was on time but not on time for take off, boarding procedure was ridiculous. AA asks that you check in 24 hours in advance but its pointless. Guests with assistance needs are called first, no problem as hectic as it is flying they need to board and be seated first. Then comes the non-sense; up next First Class, then Business Class normal stuff, then Priority Plus, then Priority, then Economy +, then group 1 followed by group 2. Why are there 8 classes of boarding, its ridiculous.My in seat monitor had issues and had to be reset the screen kept freezing, the air was extremely stale, the toilet filthy, I got half a can of ginger ale, the seat wouldn't recline, the PA system was so staticky you couldn't hear a thing the flight crew were saying. While the captain did make up for lost time, it doesn't change the fact that all of these issues occurred in the first place. AA has poor processes in place. Now lets talk about the return trip which had an even bigger catalyst of issues go wrong. Again I did on line check in, and you can't do it before 24 hours so if you think you are going to o it 28, 35 or 48 hours you can't, its 24 exactly.For those of you who love the boarding passes via app, AA is going to give you a paper one any way so using the app is also pointless. My AA app gave me my boarding pass which had one gate number, I got to the airport they make you tag your own bag then take it to the counter to be checked and paid for again in case you go over the weight limit. If I have to check my own bag and then stand in line to have it weighed and essentially checked then why can't I just stand in one line for both vs having to stand in two lines. I digress, once your bag is weighed, they printed me another boarding pass which had another gate number. I asked which to follow they said the app is the most updated as it will also give you boarding times and you can track your bag status. I get to the terminal that the app said; an hour and a half later there's no plane outside. I ask what is going on and then they tell me that the plane has been changed and now leaving from another gate. Okay well no over the head announcement? Passengers are to look at the monitors and if you have notifications turned on you'll receive updated. My thing is if I don't do that why is there no over the head announcement, they announce final boarding calls and practically everything else. So I run down to the next gate mind you this is now the third gate change. I get to the terminal and then am informed the flight is delayed. We get delayed from 5 to 6 and then another delay from 6 to 6:45. No explanation given for all the issues, I over hear its due to a technical glitch or software. No apologies by any AA staff, in fact they seemed annoyed and frustrated that all of us paying passengers are trying to get home or to another destination and that connecting flights aren't going to sit around. We now get on board and now theres another delay, the crew that pushes the plane back from the gate is busy so another 40 minutes waiting for that. By the time we actually take off its closer to 7:45. Again with the staticky PA system on this plane we can't hear a darn thing. The plane also filthy, they stated due to the delay in arriving and the plane didn't have time to get properly cleaned and prepped for our flight. Again same terrible boarding procedures, no apologies, nothing.

My husband has a small checked bag and I have a larger one (same bags we always use). We had NO carry-ons. His bag weighed 45 lbs and mine weighed 53. On top of the $50 we had paid to check them, we were charged $100 for the 3 LBS my bag was overweight. Combined we were under 100 (50 lbs allowed for each bag) plus we had no additional weight in the form of carry-ons. We were told that we'd have to unpack things from my bag in order to not pay the fee. My husband's bag had no room plus they'd already checked it and sent it away. So, your suggestion was for me to put my clothing in my invisible carry-on? Or did you expect me to carry it loose in my arms through LAX? So we paid your stupid fee.Then while waiting at the gate your staff could be heard complaining about having to fly to Vegas again. Once we started boarding, the greeter/flight attendant was clearly annoyed at your customers and having to work.Mid flight your team began passing out beverages and snacks. My husband, myself and a women next to us waited patiently for your team (who all appeared to be put out by being there) to come to us. We all had our tray tables down and were looking at them.

Flying is is problematic, you always have issues using various airlines,but last time we used AA it took the cherry from the top!It's related to the personal from LAX, Terminal 6. First of all, we never got any info via e-mail re. which terminal and gate we'll fly from. Our shuttle bus driver had to stop at terminal 4 for us to check which terminal our flight was schedule at. So we went on to terminal 6 which is under construction, noisy, horrible to fly from!Once we got inside, we walked to the screens to get info re. the flight, gate. An AA employee, started to yell at me to come over. She was aggressive and came to us, trying to get us to come and check our bag right away. I was taken back and felt hassled since she kept yelling after me. There was barely a line, so I don't get the attitude. When we got in line to check a suitcase, the employee didn't want to help us, was rude and when I asked about the possibility of changing seats (we had exit row seating) she assured me I'd be helped at the gate. These people need more training and need to be nice to the customers. I've never seen anything like it.But the real problem was at the gate, #62. For a long time, no AA employee showed up. Finally a lady showed up but didn't open the gate for 20 minutes. She kept pushing us away. I wanted to exchange my seats since I have back problems and my husband just recovered from a knee injury, we didn't feel comfortable having exit row seats. Other passengers had other issues to address, we kept forming lines and not getting any help. Finally, an employee named Philip W. told us the gate is opened. We lined up, after a while he told us the line is only for people who need to check luggage. It was 10 minutes till boarding and we weren't getting any help. The same people, like me were lining up to get help and we weren't getting any.  Finally, he announced he can help w. other issues. Another line to wait in. When my turn came he told me he refuses to help me. I stepped aside. It was very frustrating to not be able to voice your issue. I was going to the line to board the plane since I had Priority Access and I've seen and heard people yelling coming from gate. Customers were asking for a Manager to come over. Customers were getting fed up not getting helped by this guy who was pushing people away, not dealing w. customers's issues. I've never seen such a horrible, selfish attitude before. There were people who were trying to get on the plane, going to a funeral, worse issues than mine. I told him he needs to be nicer to customers and help them. He blocked my access and my husband's access on the plane, we were asked to step aside and he called security. What for exactly? That he wasn't doing his job? After the TSA showed up, I talked to them, I explained them the situation and they let me get on the plane immediately. I felt like Philip W. had a personal issue with me at that point and he was using his power to make my life hard. As a paying customer, long time customer of AA, that's not acceptable. He was on a personal vendetta. On the plane, other passengers that witnessed this incident told me that it wasn't fair how we were treated.Otherwise, the flight attendants were OK. But it made it for my worst flying experience ever and we felt like we were treated unfairly. Also, it was very hard to get in touch and file a complaint with the airline, I don't know if they cared to do anything about this case.

At this point we had already checked in our previous bag. well by the time we got to the front of the line the lady that helped us explained that we wouldn't have enough time to check in our luggage so that it could arrive with the other luggage we had already sent earlier. When i proceeded to explain to her that the other customer rep never bothered telling us that we could only have so many bags with us when we board the plane and that this should have been communicated to us, she abruptly interrupted me and said regardless of what happen we would not only be having this luggage arrive after the one we had just checked but that we would be missing our flight as well because we didn't check in all the baggage we had. Mind you we we were never told this when we first checked in our luggage (we had all our bags with us) and in my honest opinion anyone who has to carry some type of medical machine such as the cpap shouldn't be counted as luggage because this is a medical necessity, not a want its a need. This lady didn't even let me speak long enough to tell my side of the story and you could see that she could care less about the situation or how angry i was. Some customer service they have. If it were up to me they would have no stars. This airline is ridiculous and you want to know the worst part is they didn't even bother to give us an apology for the miscommunication on their behalf. When we finally got thru airport security we went to our designated gate. We were there because that was the place where we were told we would be boarding for our next flight. After that we moved to 3 more different gates till finally reaching the correct one. We jumped around from one gate to another because when we would ask they would tell us we were at the correct one and when we start asking several questions is when we would find out we were in the wrong place. So frustrating. I felt like a flea jumping around from one place to the next. Im so disappointed with this airline and i told my daughter that if we fly, AA will not be the service we use, unless we have no other choice but even then i would think twice or maybe just drive to my destination.

On behalf of American Airlines we welcome the opportunity to respond to your concerns.We realize that schedule changes can be an unexpected, and often unwelcome, event for those of us who carefully plan itineraries and count on the airline to operate as scheduled. In fact, most schedule changes are negligible; flight times are often recalculated by just a few moments due to seasonal fluctuations in weather patterns or as more direct routes of flight open up. On the other hand, we must occasionally realign flight schedules altogether for reasons such as equipment use or scheduled maintenance, gate arrival/departure slot changes and air traffic control restrictions. In all cases, we try to work with our customers to minimize any inconvenience, and I am sorry we weren't more successful this time.We do all possible to avoid disruptions to our schedules, sometimes changes are unavoidable. When disruptions do occur, we will do our best to minimize your inconvenience. Still, in some cases, schedule irregularities may arise so quickly that we have only a limited ability to provide advance notice, and we are very sorry for any inconvenience that this caused.Mrs. Bourdo, again, thank you for the email. We regard every contact from our customers as a welcome opportunity to listen, learn and most importantly, improve. It is a privilege to have you as our customer. Thanks for absolutely nothing but a complete brush off and not even so much as acknowledging my request for a partial refund at minimum.

I'll admit I messed up the booking at first. \u00a0But I called within an hour to change the flight, most airlines forgive this if you do it quickly enough and the flight is not processed. \u00a0They did it. \u00a0Fine. \u00a0The problem is the lady on the phone booked the wrong day for my flight.I call again to fix this the next day when I caught the problem. \u00a0The flight I need is for tomorrow. \u00a0They said they no longer have seats and that there's nothing they can do. \u00a0Nor will they compensate me, nor will they refund my ticket even though they made a mistake and it's because of the time lost booking the wrong flight that I can't make the flight I actually needed to be on.Normally, I would be a mad, but I'm beyond distraught now, because that flight is to see my aunt in Texas who is literally dying because they found lymphoma in her bone marrow (90%) the other day and she will likely be on her way out at any moment.I told them this. \u00a0This changed nothing. \u00a0In fact the supervisor, Angela, began blaming me for the problem because I had booked the wrong date by mistake. \u00a0However she never cited how I called to fix it immediately and I was told by her subordinate that they had fixed it and that everything was fixed. \u00a0When I pressed this issue she said there's no way for her to know that conversation, even though she later admitted they record all of the phone calls.She then said I had to work with customer relations, but that they are closed on weekends (which is ridiculous, seeing as that's when most people fly I'm pretty sure) and that it would take 7-10 business days. \u00a0At that rate it could take 14 days before I get a reply!I told her I don't have the luxury of time and that there is just one southwest flight left that I could book for the day I need and that if I could just get my money back I could book it and see my aunt.She didn't budge and blamed me again and continued to ignore her employee's mishandling of the situation which made this situation transpire. \u00a0She eventually hung up on me after I said I would be calling around other departments to try and see if they would be more willing to fix the problem. \u00a0She said I was threatening her. \u00a0In reality, I was trying to handle a very serious problem, a problem she wouldn't/couldn't help with.If this review goes anywhere please note I recorded my convo with Angela and that I can definitely provide documentation about my aunt who will remain nameless.In summary, \u00a0American Airlines has made a company structure to where their people effectively behave in a heartless manner. American has systematically structured itself to where it takes as little responsibility as possible, instead of focusing on helping and serving its customers as much as possible. Eventually it's own employees adopt the same mentality. \u00a0As a result we (the customers) talk to people like Angela who are unwilling and/or unable to help us no matter how legitimate our issue, because a mentality of \"just following orders\" has embedded itself into American Airline's employees. \u00a0Which thereby allows it's people to not care about what they are doing, because in their minds they are not responsible for anything they do, no matter how heartless.Think I'm reaching? \u00a0Has anyone ever heard of the Milgram experiment? \u00a0Consider googling that. \u00a0In the mean time, I'll be scrounging all the money I've got to see if I can afford that Southwest ticket. \u00a0I'm told they have a heart."}, {"count": 2125, "date": "8/19/2017", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "review": "The American Airlines staff in LAX were the rudest workers, unbelievable.

The net of this is that while I'm eager to reach the 2 million mile milestone (although with Platinum Pro, lifetime 'Platinum' level has lost its luster), unless there are major changes I will be transferring my status and relationship to Delta, as i'm sure many AA customers will do.Admiral's Club Lounges - mediocre at best when compared to other carriers. \u00a0In places like LAX where the USAir merger supports another terminal (6), there is no lounge, diluting the value. \u00a0Wifi is spotty, food options rarely change and are minimal (compared to Delta) and while there is claim of refurbishing, there has been very little that has improved the overall quality. \u00a0Most importantly, Delta offers complimentary lounge access to top tier levels. American does not.'Advantage miles' - it's becoming more and more difficult to use them, in most cases when we try to apply the we've had to adjust by days to find flights that will accommodate. \u00a0Most frustrating, award travel is not eligible for upgrades. \u00a0Delta allows (and we have frequently received) upgrades using award tickets. \u00a0I understand AA is implementing something to allow upgrades under certain conditions; I am not hopeful it will be sufficiently pervasive to have a positive impact.Upgrades - i'm typically upgraded an average of 25% of my flights. \u00a0My wife is upgraded 75% of her flights on similar routes with Delta. \u00a0I've flown Delta (gold level) several times in the last year and have been upgraded more than half the time.Service quality - just when AA was upgrading planes which was badly needed, the USAir acquisition seems to have put the service quality and use of aged aircraft back a decade. \u00a0Many planes still don't have wifi, entertainment nor electrical outlets (not to mention subpar seats in both business and economy. For those of us who fly for work, not having power is a show stopper. \u00a0Executive platinum reservation line - often delays in answering, in some cases call backs as long as an hour. \u00a0Delta premium line never puts you on hold.Systemwide upgrades - As EP I've received 8 SUs per year for many years. \u00a0I have yet to use them all because when I've tried they are typically not available and / or American flights do not operate in the routes we want to book. \u00a0AA has seen fit to reduce this perk from 8 to 4 this year, but given they're nearly useless based on years of trying, this does not really seem to matter.Partners - One-World is limited and/or partners do not have the same relationship with AA as with other airlines. \u00a0When I'm placed on a codeshare with Alaska, for example, my status doesn't allow for upgrades nor many related perks. \u00a0Delta's relationship with Alaska allows all transferable privileges. \u00a0in seeking a flight overseas AA quoted a flight with Cathay Pacific at $3400 when the exact same routing was available through other sources, including Cathay direct for less than $1500. \u00a0American's agent simply told me, it's what Cathy quotes them. \u00a0Advantage miles earned - the one thing AA had over Delta was it's mile for mile earning potential. The change to cost-based mileage award this year, while consistent with many airlines, including Delta, is understandable but removed the one reason American could retain loyalty. This list could be longer but I don't think piling on makes the situation suggesting change any more compelling that it already is. \u00a0Despite trying, I see nothing American is doing to move forward with its customer service and is in fact back sliding to the point that remaining with AA is hard to explain to my colleagues and family.I truly hope something changes in future. American has been a great, yet aging and now obsolete service. \u00a0Unfortunately, it's going the way of the dodo."}, {"count": 2208, "date": "12/24/2016", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "If we could give 0 stars we would.

AA can't guarantee my bag will arrive on time and 2. AA can't guarantee nothing will be stolen from my bag.

I was willing to pay a checked bag fee of $25 or $50 to bring a carry-on bag and they said no. The only option was to pay $500 more to purchase a economy ticket so I could bring a carry on bag.

I was supposed to take the early morning flight out to St. Martin with a connecting flight in Miami on Thursday, Nov. 15. All seems to be okay at this point because I got through the extremely long line for the TSA security check and was sitting around the waiting area to board my flight 20 minutes early. Then the front desk lady at AA comes on and announces that it is a full flight and they would truly appreciate if anyone offered to CHECK-IN their luggage free of charge. I sit there and contemplate for a short bit and decide, I WILL BE A GOOD SAMARITAN and offer to CHECK-IN my bag because I want to help. So out of the goodness of my heart, I walk up and offer to check in my bag. The lady kindly states, \"Thank you for your help. Your bag will be sent directly to St. Martin.\"I make my connecting flight to Miami then to St. Martin. After literally a whole day of traveling from the early morning flight to arriving in St. Martin at 10pm the last thing I want to hear is your luggage didn't make it here.I walk up to make a claim at the AA booth and I see an irritated person standing on the side of the booth telling his tale of how his luggage wasn't there. I try to ask the other person by the booth but he states he is just the security and I should wait to talk to \"Kevin\" the baggage claim guy. So in the shuffle of another giant family looking for their missing luggage they get the glorious message that their luggage was stored in the back. They get there's and move on.Kevin looks my way to assist me but I turn to the irritated pacing person along the sideline and kindly say, \"He was next in line and I'll wait.\" In the midst of this guy telling his tale of his lost luggage, I look over and start small talk and try to figure out how bad his story sucks versus mine and just making light of the situation because ultimately it boils down to, \"THIS SUCKS.\" But it all turns out to a worthwhile adventure because in the several minutes of talking to this other person, I start thinking, \"Hey this guy looks familiar....hmmmm...\"(talk, talk, talk....)The longer I talk to him I think, \"Man, this guy looks REALLY familiar!\"Then by the end of our conversation I realize, \"Holy crap this is one of the Corey's\"Then literally a second later, the funny security guy who's been helping to joke around with me to help lighten the situation says, \"Hey man, you're Corey!\"Corey Fieldman replies, \"Yeah, that's me.\"I dead-on turn my head and stare at him point blankly and say, \"I KNEW IT!\"Then the luggage claim guy says, \"Hey, you were in Goonies!\"Corey Fieldman shyly nods and says, \"Yeah, I was.\"Now, I am googley eyed adoring him even more and ask shyly, \"Would you hate me if I asked for your autograph and for a picture?\"He was soooooooo sweet and said, \"No not at all.\"I almost lost it and started jumping up and down like a little school girl.After all this mess with AA losing both our bags, I was able to get an awesome twist of fun perks and mini adventure out of it in the end.

My wife and I, along with several others rush over to Gate 44 to catch flight AA 3692 to San Diego, which departs at 10:30pm.10:10pm: Wife and I, and several others, reach Gate 44, which requires us take a American Airlines shuttle over to the commuter boarding terminal. However, they stop all of us from boarding the shuttle because they tell us flight AA 3692 has been closed for boarding, and that the flight got moved to an earlier take off at 10:20pm, rather than 10:30pm as originally scheduled...WHAT THE FUCK???!!! \u00a0The staff directs us to go to the Customer Service Counter to get a new flight and compensation.10:20pm: About a dozen of us are in line and yelling at the 2 ladies working the Customer Service booth. American Airlines would only rebook us on another flight in which the next available one was 6:30am the next morning, no hotel would be provided, nor food or drink vouchers, nor a bus to get us all to San Diego. They can't tell us anything about our baggage, whether its staying in LAX or on its way to SAN, and that we had to go down to Baggage Claim office downstairs.10:45pm: Our baggage is nowhere to be found. The American Airlines lady says that the baggage is now with American Eagle, whom closes at 10:30pm, so she can't call them and that most likely they're on their way to SAN. American Eagle is a separate entity, even though they are owned by the same parent company. \u00a0WTF? \u00a011:20pm: \u00a0Me, the wife, and another fellow female AA victim rent a car at Avis, for $89, for the drive back to San Diego. \u00a0No way in Hellwere way spending the night at LAX. FYI11:45 is when our flight to SAN was supposed to be landing. \u00a011:50pm: Fellow AA victim is on the phone with AA trying to sort out WTF was happening. \u00a0After 30+ minutes and being transferred several times, she convinces AA to deliver out bags to our respective homes. \u00a0We ask about getting reimbursed for the rental car expense, but the baggage person can't help with that. \u00a0We let it rest until tommorrow. \u00a0Also, during this phone call, we learn that the AA pilot hadn't actually taken off until around 10:55pm, because he was waiting for the dozen of us to get on board.

I recently traveled overseas from Philadelphia to Greece with my family. Firstly, I expected anyone with children to be among the first to be boarded. I was, I believe the only one with a 9 month old baby in addition to my 3 1/2 year old toddler. To my surprise, and I'm sure the other parents, we never heard a \"anyone with young children, please feel free to board\" call. Secondly, I was extremely aggravated and angered that I couldn't get the bassinet and seat that goes with it for my baby and I. I called your airline weeks before and even 24 hours before my flight, not to mention my Travel Agent who requested that seat for me when they booked my tickets, and was told that \"we don't reserve the bassinet; it's first come, first served\". I can appreciate that and even understand that. What I can't understand is when I arrive at the gate to get it I am told that \"a bassinet is available however the seats have been taken by some people who requested the extra leg room\". ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! I guess your company is fine with giving a seat to someone for extra leg room over a baby who needs a bassinet to sleep in? I had to hold my baby for a 9 hour flight and keep handing her over to my husband to hold while I took my toddler to the bathroom or so I could eat my meal that the flight attendant kindly put aside for me. The flight attendants were the best part of the flight. Thirdly, I didn't appreciate the fact that the assigned seats for my family had my 3 1/2 year seated between two complete strangers while my husband and I were directly behind her with the baby. Obviously, my husband switched so that my child would be with me but who is in charge of seating arrangements that can't understand the concept of keeping a child together with their parents? You would think they'd keep a family of 3 with a lap baby all together but I guess I'm the only one who thinks like that. Suffice it to say, in all likeliness I will not be using your airline to travel in the future. I have my return tickets already booked and would probably be charged to change them or else I would switch them with another airline to return home. I will also be telling all my friends and family, who are frequent flyers, about my experience and urge them to reconsider an airline that would put any child's comfort, on an already long and uncomfortable flight for them, second to a young and healthy person's need for extra leg room."}, {"count": 2488, "date": "12/15/2014", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "If I could give zero stars I would.

It would have been better to give my points away than travel using American Airlines. This particular flight 292 from LAX to JFK was awful. We were supposed to take off at 6am and have been told 7 times that they are not sure when we will depart because the air condition is broken on this brand new A321T super modern plane that has plenty of room in first class and business first class but make you sit knees to chair in the main cabin with some cool monitors and super limited foot space because of \"premium\" entertainment service because of it. Wow, the flight attendant just told us the we all had to get off the plane and as we were all getting our stuff from the overhead and starting to depart he got on the intercom and told us that he misspoke and we only had to get off if we wanted too in order to eat because they are not serving food on this plane while at the gate. Now when half the plane had already departed we are told that everything is fixed but now we have to wait for everyone to get back on the plane and will depart as soon as that happens. Now I remember why I stopped flying American. I was hoping that the new planes and merger would have fixed the delayed flight issues that American has 95% of the time.

I was a bit shocked that, on a flight of nearly 6 hours, they didn't even provide a light snack or a bag of peanuts for their passengers. \u00a0Also, while they did have an \"entertainment center\" in the back of every seat, I use the term entertainment loosely, as most of the movie and TV program options were absolute crap. \u00a0 The in-flight WiFi was either switched off or wasn't installed on this plane. Luckily I slept during most of the flight, and kept myself busy with work for the remainder of it. During the flight from LAX, they showed several advertisements explaining how AA is improving everything about their company - buying new planes, changing the look of their website, changing the look of their pajamas (I guess for first class passengers on long haul flights, maybe?). \u00a0But to be honest, none of that means anything when their flights are frequently late for various reasons (on this trip alone, all 3 of my flights were delayed, 2 of them by more than an hour), they offer few amenities to their passengers, and the amenities they do offer are half-assed at best."}, {"count": 2492, "date": "12/22/2017", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "The customer service is horrible.

On Friday the 15th of December she was dropped off at New Albany Airport by her school to catch her flight home for Christmas. As normal she checked in and went to her gate where she was told by the gate agent that her flight was delayed approximately 1 hour. \u00a0Serena asked the gate agent about her connection in Charlotte NC and if everything was going to be ok and was responded to:\" It should be fine! The plane will now get in at 10:15pm and your next flight leaves at 10:25pm so you will just have to hustle!\"First off, the gate agent in New Albany made a conscious decision to put a 15-year-old 5' 3\" 110lb girl on a flight with a 10-minute connection. \u00a0So, I asked myself a question: Ok that makes sense via I am sure they new about the connection and would hold the plane 5 or 10 minutes so that an unaccompanied Minor was safe. \u00a0As promised the plane landed at the gate at 10:15pm and Serena darted off the plane and got to the next gate at 10:33pm (2 terminals away) 8 minutes after the scheduled departure time. \u00a0Here is where it gets interesting, the gate agent in New Albany knew she was 15 and put her on the flight and never told anyone that they need to call ahead and hold a flight for 10 minutes. \u00a0When Serena arrived at the gate hyperventilating from the terminal run she was greeted by 2 gate agents that said the flight had just left and she needed to go to customer service to figure out what she should do!So, let me ask you a question Mr. Parker: I little girl running and out of breath comes up to you and says I'm here for my flight. How would you respond knowing that she is a young girl? \u00a0Would you just look at her and say you need to go to customer service or would you try and help her? \u00a0The gate agents pointed her in the direction of customer service and never offered to help her. \u00a0When she got there, she waited for 45 minutes to 1 hour to speak to someone. \u00a0At that point I spoke to the agent with my concerns and I was told she would spend the night in the UM room. (unaccompanied Minor room which was secure). At this point she was escorted to a safe facility.My disappointment with your Airline has nothing to do with a flight being delayed, it has to do with your people in multiple airports doing there jobs only and not caring about their customers! \u00a0In New Albany the gate agent put Serena on a flight (which was easier) then making sure the connection was good for a young girl. (make the problem the other airports versus hers) In Charlotte the gate agents seeing a distressed little girl and pointing her versus helping her. (I'm sure they had a long day and wanted to go home). \u00a0Another question for you Mr. Parker: You have 3 children I understand, is this acceptable to you? Is this how you would want your children handled? \u00a0Its not about the delay its about the way your people don't care! \u00a0We are all very busy people in todays world and sometimes we need to slow down and care, especially when it comes to children.I look forward to your response!

We were not told anything other than that. We were then given the option to leave the plane but were told we would not be provided a room. About 40 minutes later we took off for Miami. We landed in Miami and waited on the tarmac for over an hour.

The plane was horrible--some armrests wouldn't move, some seats wouldn't recline, the floors in the bathroom were sticky, and the flight staff failed to put out water for a fifteen-hour flight.

About three weeks later, we get an email saying that our flight has been changed to leave three and a half hours earlier, creating a FOUR hour layover in Dallas, Texas before heading to our real destination of Cozumel. They also changed our return flight to arrive at a completely different airport on the opposite side of the city (about an hour away). This flight also included more layover time. I tried to check in online the night before our flight and checked my bags. I wanted to make sure that we could get in and on the plane quickly and easily. This is the best way to travel through any other airlines I've been on. NOT SO MUCH with American Airlines. It was upon checking in and checking my bags and feeling this great relief that a few minutes later I get the dreaded email.... they changed our flight again... HOURS before our flight. WHAT! This time they added another TWO hours layover in Dallas making it a SIX HOUR LAYOVER and it's leaving two hours earlier. We were already booked on a dawn flight. Please keep in mind that flying directly to Cozumel from Houston is only 2 hours total. Since we are flying this crappy airline, we are flying first to a more northern location to wait more than half a day and then back south to our final destination. We arrive at the airport without any sleep because they didn't tell us until 9 pm that they were changing our flight to 5:10 AM. The airport is an hour from our house and this is an international flight, so we had to leave our house by 2 am to get there on time for customs. We actually decided to leave even earlier since we couldn't sleep anyway and got to the airport by 2:30 AM. This is two hours and forty minutes before our flight and there is no one at the ticketing booth. In fact, they had a long line and all the passengers were worried about missing their flights. No one came to the booth until just past 3 am and still took on average 25 minutes for each group of travelers. We didn't get to security until about 50 minutes before our flight because of how slow the ticket agents were going. The security almost didn't let us on as a result. In fact, one of the security ladies chewed me out because I was feeling antsy and worried about making my flight. She barked that I should have gotten to to the airport well before my flight. UM, I was. It was American Airlines fault for not being at their ticketing booth on time, nor having enough agents to check in their passengers. THEY are the ones who moved our flight to the middle of the night WITHOUT our permission, and without any options to change this. It's not our fault they don't have staff to deal with these changes they inflict on their clients. Okay... I am actually on the plane and I am going to try to move past how upsetting this whole experience is and that I will waste a full day of my vacation without any sleep and stuck in an airport NORTH of my destination and departing city. The only thing that gives me peace of mind in all of this is that there are other options/airlines in the future because I will NEVER EVER EVER fly with them again after my return flight, which I pray they don't screw up too. We leave tomorrow afternoon for home on this crappy airline. All of this and they charged us baggage fees when I originally checked in online and then charged again when we checked in at the airport because they had to modify our return flight. They have yet to reimburse for the duplicate charges.A small thing I almost forgot to mention, they said they overbooked both our flights, so there weren't guaranteed seats for all their ticketed passengers. Really? I mean really? There is so much that goes into planning an international vacation other than just the flight. So many things get affected. How dare them do this to their clientele! SHAMEFUL!Tomorrow we head back home and I pray that we don't experience another nightmare. If I had the opportunity to change airlines, I would not hesitate. I think Travelocity is going to take a hit for this one too. I was on the phone with them for TWO hours trying to get another airline or fix this issue to satisfaction when all of this went so far south only hours before our departing flights. It was all in vain though. They got us returning to the correct airport, but the departing flight series stayed the disaster without any apologies either from American Airlines or Travelocity. In fact, they offered not only no apologies or discounts, coupons for comfort, they also didn't allow us our only request... to be able to sit in the presidential club for that SIX hour layover they forced us into. We didn't ask for compensation, discounts, meal tickets, first class seats or anything. We just wanted a comfortable place to sit during that hellish layover. We were denied quickly without any remorse for their errors. AWFUL customer service! The worst of the worst.

Well, this prompted a passenger pilot to speak up about this steward's attitude, and next thing you know, the two were exchanging words on the plane. One was egging on the other, and the other with his sassy diva attitude was loud and kept saying, \"oh no, don't disrespect me.\" There was some serious tension and I thought for sure the two were about to have a fist fight. They were in each other's faces up near the flight attendant area. Their exchanges of words went on the entire time they were boarding passengers, as well as after. It was so incredibly unprofessional.The bottom line: American Airlines seems to be taking the customer out of \"customer service.\" It's all about money. We ended up with, \"we're going to be taking off about 10 minutes early today,\" to arriving 30 minutes late. Thankfully, I didn't have another flight to catch right away, but mind you....this was all because they kept doing everything in their power to make sure the plane was completely full. Not an empty seat, full to the brim, running late at the expense of everyone on board. These greedy airline corporations.....

I was very happy as an Executive Platinum in 2012, upgraded often and treated well. I was in American Airlines heaven so to speak.In 2012 I flew 98,900 miles to and from Miami mostly, and just missed 100,000 by 1,100 miles. (Keep in mind I chose to fly American, meaning I had to leave out of LAX versus John Wayne because of a lack of available direct flights. This meant that I had to drive 52 miles each way just so I could fly American. I take the 6:00am flight so I can still make use of my day in Miami...which means that I have to leave my house in Orange County at 3:45am once a week.) I put in a formal request to continue Executive Platinum status. I was Denied.I was disappointed. It didn't bother me too much until I had a very displeasing incident at the Premium check in desk at LAX early in the year 2013.Every year I ride the Multiple Sclerosis 150 mile Cycling event in Miami. My carbon fiber bike weighs 16lbs, the case I ship it in is triangular shaped...combined weight was 22lbs on their scale at the counter. As an Executive Platinum, I showed them my paperwork for the event and they waived the ridiculous $150 fee. At MIA, for the return flight, the manager waived the fee as well. It took negotiating with both managers, but All was good.I brought my bike again the next year, 2013, as a Platinum, assuming they would waive the fees. They did not and it cost me $300 round trip to ship my 22lbs box/bike....meanwhile, Virgin was offering free shipment of athletic gear, including bikes.Here's the kicker, and what caused me to start flying Virgin America. When I arrived at LAX with my bike, I went to the counter. The lady behind the counter indignantly told me there was no way that my bike was going to ship for free, regardless of my request that it was for a charity event and that they had waived fees the previous year. I asked to speak to her manager, just as I had the year before as an Executive Platinum.This is where I just about threw myself over the counter and went ape. The lady would not go get the manager, she refused!! I had to go get another clerk to get the manager, they refused. I pulled out my GoPro and started recording. I asked the first clerk to state her name, she refused, the second clerk ran and got the manager. 40 minutes had passed before I was able to speak to the manager. He came out equally as indignant and told me he wouldn't say another word until I turned off the camera. So I did.This was the same manager as the year before who approved the waiving of the $150 bike fee. I shared my story about our previous experience together from the year before. I brought my paperwork, just as I had the year before.This guy...I swear...had the audacity to tell me that we had never met and that he had never, in his 10 year career at that front desk, ever waived anyone's $150 bike fee! In other words he was saying that I was lying! He further told me to pay the fee now or I was going to miss my flight, in essence forcing me to pay the ridiculous $150 fee, which I had to pay on the way back from Miami as well.Being a GoPro employee I travel with my bike quite a bit. I now fly Virgin America who, at the most, has charged me a reasonable $25 each way. I'm happy to pay that knowing that I'm getting Executive Platinum level service and a reasonable bike fee.I've since dropped down to Gold status and barely made that in 2013. This year 2014, I've flown all of 2 flights with American and it's half way the through the year. In fact the two flights I have flown with American have been using the miles I've accrued in past years.American, please reach out to me, I'd consider flying with you again on the condition of returning my $300 (which is the least you could do), offering me Executive Platinum status for the remainder of 2014, and offering all customers a more reasonable bike fee of $25.00 - $50.00I'm looking forward to hearing from you.Sincerely,W4374K4"}, {"count": 2680, "date": "11/13/2017", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Move over United. \u00a0AA is undoubtedly THE WORST airline for customer support. \u00a0I had booked first class travel to Kauai for my wife & me. \u00a0We separated 2 months before the trip. \u00a0If the pain of that weren't bad enough, AA refused to credit the first class fare I paid for my wife saying it was non-transferable. \u00a0AA reported profit of $2.6B in 2016 \u00a0happily ripping off their customers all the way to the bank,. \u00a0I didn't ask for a refund, only credit towards future travel. \u00a0Outrageous."}, {"count": 2681, "date": "6/12/2014", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Worst airline on the planet.

I waited by myself at the business line to check in, while 5 agents checked everyone else in from the priority (to my right) and the first class line (to my left). I was ignored for 20 minutes.When I pointed out to them that people in the priority line who arrived at the line much later than I did were being checked in ahead of people in the business line, I was given a stupid, snarky answer by supervisor Laura Pineda (or whatever her name was - I have no way of verifying this).After 20 minutes, I ended up moving to the priority line. The agent, as well as her supervisor, treated me as if I had personally wronged them for complaining that they were ignoring the business class line. From then on, it went downhill. The supervisor seemed focused on teaching me a lesson and wasting my time, which is fine. The kicker was that she kept walking away as if she'd grown tired of talking to me.All in all, I waited in line for 20 minutes, just to be told to go screw myself in 5 minutes.

I decided to deviate from taking Virgin America because I wanted to have plenty of flight options in case a flight was cancelled since weather can be unpredictable.

It was worth the money because it was a full flight both ways and seeing how some people put both their bags in the overhead bins rather than one bag above and one bag in the seat in front of them, it can be annoying.FLIGHT:The flight going to Chicago was very quick considering I was asleep for 90% of it.

This is one of those things where if you fly a lot, you know when something is off. The moment I pressed the button to recline, the button pushes with no pressure. That immediately tells me the seat is broken. After telling the flight attendant, she just looks back with a blank stare as if we were from outer space. She didn't say let me see if there are any open seats after everyone has boarded or let me see what I can do or anything. She did NOTHING. Thanks AA.The entertainment is archaic on the flight as you have a communial screen to watch movies or whatever is on. So, that sucked.RECOMMENDATION:Again, I only fly certain airlines when I need to and this was the case with American Airlines. As was the case with my previous experience, if you take a red-eye, then American Airlines is perfect since you'll be asleep for a majority of the flight.

Back in July my family and I went on our yearly trip to Jamaica and the only fare that was reasonable at that time was American airline. Prior to that I have always used Delta, Southwest, Spirit or Jet Blue and have never had any problems with them. I should of stuck to my guns and went back with one of those airlines but went with the better deal for that time and chose American which again was my first time using them. I have always heard bad things about American but again I went against my better judgement. We booked flight and was schedule to leave at 5:20am Tuesday morning in July. Now just to let you know that this flight was booked a month in advanced. My wife and I are both tall so we payed extra for the exit row for comfort which we do every year. So we were happy and set for our trip, or as so we thought. The night before our flight at 9pm I received a email that our flight was being delayed by until 9am and we will be taking an airbus to Philadelphia and transfer from Philly to Jamaica. I then called American reservation to see what delayed the flight and asked them is there any way we can catch an earlier flight because we have already made arrangement for our pickup in Jamaica and it would be a terrible inconvenience. I was flat out told no is was nothing they could do. So I even asked the representative do we still have our exit row seats and she said \"absolutely\". Yes I was pissed but I had no other choice. The next day we got to the airport at 6:30am checked in and I wanted to confirm that we in fact had exit row seats because again Im 6-4 and my wife is 5-11 and both needed the room for our bad knees. When I asked the check in person the question about the exit rows she told me that the airbus to philly was full and because the plane is small all seats did not have much leg room and the connecting flight was also full and all exit rows was full. I immediately told her that I paid for the seats and was told by the representative I spoke to the night before that we still had our seats. She said Im sorry but its nothing that she could do. Now I know what it felt to be denied for something that you did was right. My wife and I boarded this small airbus to Philly and it seemed like my living room was bigger then this plane. the only good thing about this airbus flight was that it was only 30 minute flight, Thank God! We then got to the connecting flight to Jamaica and again I asked the check in person if there was any way we could get the exit rows and was told no again. We board the plane and yes the seats were crunched with no room. So I sat in the aisle seat just so I could stretch my knees when I was able. Now this experience is now becoming worst. While the aisle was clear I would stretch my Knees and when a steward would walk up I would place my knees as close inside my seat as possible to not get hit. I also explained to one of the stewards of why I constantly extend my knees into the walkway aisle and she said it was ok. However, it was a older Caucasian male who for some reason didn't seem to like that I was stretching my knees into the aisle. Every time he walked pass he would bump my knees. As much as I tried to shelter my knees inside of my seat he would find a way to bump them and would give me this crazy look and not apologize. I thought maybe he was somewhat not aware he was doing this and thought maybe it was just me. So I asked my wife to be observant when he would walk pass. So at this time he was pushing the snack cart from the back to the front and my knees was slightly in the aisle and again he just ran right into my knees and didn't say one word. My wife even noticed it this time and said I need to report his actions. He knew exactly what he was doing. I don't know what was his problem whether it was with me or something else but I know I was not going to confront him due to all the negative situations going on with these airlines so I just sat and completed my flight to beautiful Jamaica. This was by far the worst experience for me with any airline. I guess I should of went with my better judgement and not fly American but I'm one to not judge a book by its color and give it a try if I have never tried it before. I can say this with ease, Ive tried American and please believe me I will never used AMERICAN AIRLINE NEVER AGAIN.

Thursday was my first time flying with American Airlines from LAX to Orlando FL. When I went to the front desk to get assistance with my ticket.

Then she could not pull up my ticket because she claimed that she couldn't find it. So I asked what else can she do because I just called customer service and they pulled my ticket up with no problem. She says oooo i don't know... I asked to make sure she was putting all the right information in. She gets an attitude and begins to talk to the other employees and ignore me. So I call the 1800 customer service hotline. They pull my ticket up right away so I try to get her attention because I still have not left her desk. She becomes irritated and raises her voice at me and says I need to relax because she is busy. Mind you I was claim I never raised my voice and I actually said excuse me when I asked for her attention despite how rube she was being with me. So at this point I am appalled that your employees act this way. I don't feel like I got treated right at all. Then not to mention my mother was flying on another flight and she cannot hear very well like most older people.

Me and my teenage daughter-LAX to Heathrow flight cancelled due to mechanical failure. Back up plan failed miserably.

Miscommunication of gate information/terminal for the next day's flight had us all moving gate location twice. Disorganized. The worst part is the inconsiderate treatment of our time and cost lost due to the cancellation of flight and the unwillingness to compensate for the inconvenience (one hotel night and a family event) I had to contact customer relations several times in order to finally receive 2 $200 vouchers WITH A YEAR EXPIRATION DATE!!

I typically don't fly this airline and they had once chance to impress me when I booked through them for a flight last minute. Sad to say it didn't happen. Luckily, after many phone calls and talking to managers over the phone after the fact, they ended up being helpful, hence the 2 star rating. However, it took a lot of time and effort to get to that point.For airlines, what makes or breaks a customers opinion is how a customer is treated in times of stress or in a difficult situation when a flight is delayed, missed, or something else happens unexpectedly. That is actually a CHANCE for them to implant a positive feeling of their brand on \u00a0a customer and to leave a lasting positive impression. It doesn't require a huge amount of effort to leave a positive impression - all it takes is a smile, display of empathy, or trying to understand where the customer is coming from, even if they might not be 100% right (for example saying \"I'm sorry, that sounds frustrating\"). Business 101: the customer is always right. Obviously most (although not all) of the AA agents haven't ever stepped foot in a business or customer service class.I showed up to a domestic flight pretty much on time, maybe running a little bit late but not by much. The check in line wait time was excessively long. Then, it turns out the security line was so long that they wouldn't even let you in to the line for 10-15 minutes (never experienced this in the Southwest or Virgin part of the airport). I got pulled away for extra screening and pat downs in a separate room for 15-20 minutes at least because some alarm was going off. When I finally get to the terminal there was chaos and several different lines. It turns out you have to take a bus from the terminal to the REAL terminal which is like 15 minutes away. This is only the case for AA. It's somewhat confusing and during peak times that area gets crowded and you have to wait in line to even board a bus. I waited in line for about 20 minutes but it turns out I was in the line for a shuttle/bus to Quantas airlines instead of AA, which means I wasted even more time.I was thrilled when I ended up getting to the REAL terminal (in the middle of nowhere, pretty unpleasant) 8-9 minutes before departure! But get this - nobody was there. No ticket agent. The other agents were busy and told us to leave them alone. After waiting for 20 minutes myself and a couple of others who got there before departure time for this same flight find an agent who tells us the flight already left. She seems annoyed and unhelpful. Apparently, based on what we were told, AA flights leave 10-15 minutes before departure time and departure time means they are in the air at that time. Let me say that when I've flown Southwest or Virgin they have always waited for me & others if anyone was running late..or should I say \"right on time\". In this case, \"missed\" my flight even though I was there before departure. And my bags went on the flight without me. I absolutely hate the shuttle/bus situation that they have at LAX with American, and the absolutely TERRIBLE customer service. There was nobody to talk to at their creepy remote terminal at night. I was actually kind of scared being there. Ultimately, I'm still not sure what AA's value proposition is to clients. Southwest is friendly and customer focused. Virgin is also customer focused, tech-savvy and fun. AA is........? Maybe its decent for business travelers but they don't have nice planes or service so I am not really sure that I get it. Their in-airport customer service is awful at the ticket counters. Literally the worst I have ever seen. The woman that talked to me there was MEAN and cold and kept repeating that I should have been at the airport even earlier than when I got there and blamed the whole thing on me. She said that she wouldn't do anything for me, I would have to buy a brand new flight and that AA doesn't re-book clients for missed flights. Maybe thats their policy but she was mean and had 0 empathy or understanding that I just wasted hundreds of dollars.All I know is that I will purposely avoid ever taking AA again, and will tell my social network to do the same.

I found out through a fellow passenger who was looking at the website for updates. Needless to say, many of us were confused and upset.

We find out there is no separate queue, so we stand in the long queue which also clubs a bunch of angry people who missed their flights waiting to sort out alternative arrangements. This was still ok, since we were 2 hrs ahead of time, so nothing can go wrong. WRONG. The attendant comes to us 10 min later asking us to use self serve kiosk, despite not being sure of it being the right way, So we walk some distance, go to the kiosks and try to checkin the bags and register the toddler. It gives an error as expected and we are made to go back to the line which is now longer. Still 100 min to flight, no problem, right? WRONG. There is only one attendant serving the bunch and she is struck with a reservation for 10 min. Now the toddler is getting restless and we are close to an hour from the plane, so I approach the supervisor saying that we are getting close to the flight time and if the checkin could be done in a separate line. She had only one reply for any question I asked with a rude expression on her face 'Sir, please go back and stand in the line. You will be helped'. How will I be helped if I miss my flight despite reaching the airport two hours ahead of time? So I go back, stand in the line for another 20 min before a kind assistant allows us to use priority boarding to check-in. How the other woman was promoted above this woman I would never know.

My card was charged and I was given instruction on how to send the vouchers to american so my tickets would be issue. I get an email yesterday that they could not issue my tickets. So I call and the lady explains that somehow the said there was 6 vouchers, even though there was 5 passengers total. She proceeds to help me, issues the tickets and gives me a new record locator. Today I open my card information and I have been charged another $154.00 per ticket (so times 5). I call and this Brenda explains that since the initial change did not go through now they are changing the difference in fair for the day I called which is now $154.00. I explain to her, you have charged me the difference once already for $367.20. She says we cannot see that. You need to take that with your credit card company. So my only option is cancel the whole reservation gets vouchers again and deal with them again at a later time (within a year) or suck this up to see my family in Puerto Rico before I deploy.

Second, this is not my first unpleasant experience with American Airlines and it is not my second, more like my tenth. Therefore, I felt compelled to write a review about my most recent experience. I had my 14 year old niece visit from the east coast. Since she is a minor, I had to pay 150$ extra each way for her to be accompanied by an AA agent, in which states they would greet her at the gate and take her to her connecting gate and if any delays or problems she would be with them at all times. Well, she lands in Dallas and no one was there to assist her. Thank god she is mature and knows how to walk around an airport and find her next gate. Not to mention, that all of the unaccompanied minors are wearing big laminates around their necks with their info and bright green tags on their bags and wrist, so I am not sure how one missed her. She gets to her get and makes the next flight which happen to be not only delayed four hours but gate changed and flight number changed! She makes it to la and when she lands there someone tells her to wait and that I had to go in to lax (busiest mother Effin airport ever to get her) I told her to just come to baggage and meet me outside like the AA worker told me I could on the phone. She was fine and we left. I should be refunded the 150$ due to no help whatsoever, so I call and they tell me to email a complaint which could take months to get a response if so! Hahah Her time in LA was up and come time to her previously booked flight back to the east (in which I had to call to have AA book her due to her being a minor and they put me on the beat flight etc). We get calls noting the flight was delayed an hour. Then another hour. So we finally get to the airport I fill out the paperwork which takes forever for them to punch in the computer for some idiotic reason. We get her ticket and proceed to security. I asked security do I need to take her to the gate, he said no of course not. So I say goodbye and get in my car and leave the nightmare LaX around rush hour. I am almost on the 405 and my niece calls me and informs me they won't let her get on the plane without me there. She needs an adult to supervise her get on the plane and board. You don't want to know my initial reaction but I quickly turn around and get back in about ten minutes, park and run through security yelling at the most uneducated and un-knowledgable worker I have ever witnessed. I get through and run to her plane making it with ten minutes left in boarding!! Woo hoo I thought!! Wrong..... I get to the counter to experience the most rude and obnoxious women I have ever experienced. Her name was Maria-Elena in case you encounter her. She proceeds to yell at me of course I have to be here blah blah like I am some worthless piece of shit. I yelled back and then she tells me my niece is a minor and she can't let her on this flight because it is the last connecting flight and they're not allowed on last connecting flights. What?!? Did I just hear that correctly? Yes. So the original flight AA booked for my niece to come back is not allowed?!? So I wasted five hours at the airport, my gas, 40$ in parking, my time and my sanity to only have to turn her around and go back to my house to only be informed after spending three hours on the phone with agent after agent and supervisor that she is only allowed to take the red eye flights due to her not being allowed to be I a last connecting flight. Wow. So I now am back at midnight waiting for her 1250 am flight with no sleep, work at 5 am and absolutely not one worker at AA being pleasant once again. And not to mention they flew her bag the day before and when I asked if it would be there waiting three different responses and all said \"oh, I don't know\". Even the supervisor!!! Wow! Shocker! Not. They are the absolute worst airline in this entire country. Even flying first class like I always do, they are the rudest and ugliest staff I have ever encountered. Last time ever using them.

I literally had to get up 3 or 4 times before hearing what they said. Sitting on the plane, what more can I say. \u00a0It's the worst seats, and not the cleanest (they didnt' do a thorough job cleaning the back pouches) .

My daughter's school was unfortunate to book their flights thru AA for their once in a lifetime trip to space camp in Alabama. There were 15 ten-year-olds traveling with 3 adult chaperones. First of all their flight had to turn around after being in the air for 15 minutes due to a broken generator. No one who works for AA helped them thru the process of re booking flights (due to flight being canceled) and setting up accommodations. AA staff said that the teachers had to call the company for re booking options. The teachers were eventually able to re book their flights by phone for the following day. However, AA did not offer them any sort of compensation for their missed flight. The teachers felt that it was because they were children as other adults on the same canceled flight received some sort of compensation. Another reason I will never fly with AA is because I booked my flight thru cheap tickets.com and called AA to get seat assignments as I was traveling with my young son. An AA customer service rep told me that I would have to pay extra (over $200) if I wanted to confirm seating by my son. He basically told me that if I don't pay the fee then I would not sit by my son for the flight. I know I shouldn't have booked thru a third party company (this is the first time that I had done so) but to tell me that I had to pay extra to sit by my son is ridiculous. I had also booked a flight with United Airlines thru cheap tickets \u00a0and had no problem confirming my seating by my son. The UA customer rep was happy to help me and made sure that I was seated by my son for both flights with them at no extra charge.

AA is byfar the worst airline experience ever. AVOID AVOID AVOID. On 12/16/12, \u00a0I had a 7 hour layover in LAX so of course, I left. My friend got me back to AA by about 5:40PM for my 6:25PM flight to HNL-- which is cutting it close I admit but I would have made it... but I had a check-in luggage. Stupid check-in luggage policy was that I had to make it 45 minute prior to check in bags. So I missed my entire flight over that. Seriously!? I had no idea I could have checked my luggage already. Maybe if they let us know more clearly of their policies. Ugh.. Luckily, I had a place to stay for the night. Okay, so I thought... NBD, i'll catch a flight tomorrow. I go to the AA counter. The lady at the counter was so unhelpful saying that I would get out of LAX - HNL only on 12/28 and I would have to pay $150 for that. Only after she offered me a $2000 ticket on 12/18 did she say I had the option of standing-by for the next day's flights starting at 8AM. Of course I would try to standby! Why didn't she offer that to be in the beginning instead of her bitch face blaming me for something that I couldn't help. The way she acted was as if I had just punched her in the face or something. What kind of customer service is that?! So the next day, 12/17/12 I get to LAX 6AM on the dot, I don't have a confirmed ticket of course. I tell the lady at the priority check-in/ticketing area that I need to get on the standby and check in my luggage and she tells me to go the kiosks. I head to the kiosks which are super far away and a 5 minute walk from the ticketing desk. I go stand there for 15 min. Turns out, I was in the wrong line!! I was supposed to go to Resolutions!! So I head to resolutions wait for another 10 minutes and find out that I was supposed to be at the original ticketing line!!!! So I stood in 2 WRONG LINES and wasted half an hour!! Stupid guard lady at the ticketing was the place where I was supposed to be in line. FML. I probably could have made the ticketing counter already if I had stood in the right line. Instead, I end up having to wait another 45 minutes until I get to the front of the ticketing counter of the correct line and by then its 7:16AM I've missed the 45 minute mark for check-in time for luggage AGAIN. (8AM flight to HNL) YEYYYYYYY. *\\_.____._/* FML FML FML SERIOUSLY AA?! AGAIN?!? Clearly this was not my fault but the result of shoddy workers who don't know anything.So I miss the standby for 8AM to HNL which is the one where I would have had to most success trying to standby for since most people miss the early flight due to sleeping in. And lo and behold many trying to standby for 10:30AM flight missed the 8AM one. FOOOOOK YOU AMERICAN. Trying to keep calm, I tell myself I will make the 10:30AM flight. I will make the 10:30AM flight. I get on the standby list and I'm at #5. But, by the time it's 10:20AM and I'm watiing to see if I can get on the 10:30AM flight at the gate, oops sorry we \u00a0put prirority memebers ahead of you so you're at #8 now. Plus the flight is full anyways. FML again. To make things worse I see one of my high school classmates getting on the 10:30AM flight.Side note: my luggage flew away on the 10:30AM flight without me on it. So why then could I not get on my 6:25PM flight yesterday AA? HYPOCRITES. YOU TOLD ME I HAD TO BE ON THE FLIGHT WITH MY CHECK-IN LUGGAGE. LIARS.I've been STUCK AT LAX SINCE 6AM please let me go. Now no choice but to wait for the 4:20PM flight standby. I go to the customer service desk they have at the gates specifically for AA. Find out that ALL THE FREAKING WORKERS downstairs are not even AA workers!! WTF no wonder I got pushed in all the wrong lines. They're not even employed by AA and therefore do not know policy and have no freaking idea WTF is going on at all. They just work for LAX. WOW. Just. Wow. If you actually had competent workers you would have been able to prevent all these people missing their flights being in wrong lines. So at the ticket counter I find out I have been bumped even further down the line to #12 for the standby 4:20PM flight. Again, WTF AA? Luckily this nice egyptian man helped me get a flight home for CONFIRMED tickets $75 for a 5:30 flight to Lihue then to HNL. THANK GOD. But then I was stuck at LAX from 6:00AM - 5:30PM. Literally the worst experience in my life. And I tried to hog plugs at the AA service area, but was scolded by the black worker lady because some other black people wanted to charge their stuff, pretty sure she was just being mean to me because she was racist (I'm asian). I had just gotten to the chargers TOO!! I needed to charge my stuff for a long flight to hawaii since everything was DEAD since I've been at that god forsaken airport for so long. FML.

She advised me that my bag wasn't picked up until 1pm and it would be 4-6 hrs before delivery. I said absolutely not. I was told it would be here by 1:30 and found it unacceptable to have to wait until 5-7pm. I asked to speak to her supervisor. She refused. I asked her to have someone call me. She refused.

My experience with AA was awful. First, I booked a ticket online back in June for 3 passengers traveling to Florida and the tickets ended up being nonrefundable. The website was not very clear. I only realized it was nonrefundable when I received the confirmation email and read the really tiny print at the bottom. However, this was not the issue. The travel date was in August and during the month before the trip, I found out I was pregnant and the Zika virus was in Florida. I tried changing the destination of our trip and AA wanted to charge me an additional $600 to change the flight ($200 per ticket) even though each ticket only initially costed $256 and even though the new destination was already more expensive. I called the reservation line and was advised to get a note from my doctor stating I could not travel to FL due to my pregnancy and to upload it online using the \"refund\" link. I got the note and tried to upload it online but was unable to use the refund link due to our nonrefundable tickets. I called reservations again and was advised to cancel the trip before I could contact customer relations (there is no phone number for AA customer relations by the way) via email with my request. With the reservation cancelled, I contacted customer relations and waited for 3 days for a response. They ultimately denied my request via email with no real contact information to discuss anything further. I called reservations for the third time and requested my original trip be rebooked at no cost to me. The representative did this without a problem (so she said) it turned out, she rebooked my reservation with no seats! So when I went to select my seats online, I was being charged $66 more for new seats. I called reservations again (this is call number 4) and requested seats at no additional cost to me since I was advised to cancel the initial trip only to be denied my request. The representative advised me that my seats will be selected at the airport. At this point I am livid, I advised the representative to put me through to a supervisor to get things sorted out immediately at no cost to me. The supervisor was polite and helpful and the seats were booked at no charge to me however, with everything I went through for this trip and the inconsiderate and deceitful tendencies of this airline that were exposed during this horrendous process, I will never fly with AA again."}, {"count": 3401, "date": "10/6/2014", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Never ever fly on American Airlines again. I was one of many unfortunate passengers on flight 2427 that was cancelled in DFW. While bad weather and mechanical faults are often unavoidable, staff responses to them are. After waiting on the plane for 2 hours, we were asked to get off the plane bcs of a mechanical fault that they could not fix. It was about 2 am at this point and our plane was originally scheduled to leave at 9.30pm. This is the AA response to a cancelled flight after they asked us to get off the plane and stand in line for them to arrange alternate flights:1. They took care of 1st class and abandoned everyone else, including the elderly and parents with children. They gave us a number to call and told us to look for alternate flights. We all started calling but stayed in our place inline. I wanted to also be put on wait list for other flights which the service person did not offer me.2. At 3 am they said: our shift is over. You need to go to gate 23 and they will take care of you. They walked away. We rushed to gate 23 no one was there except a janitor who felt sorry for us and told us no one will be here until 5-6 am. AA staff lied to us. We were left without food or water and all airport stores were closed. 3. I was issued boarding passes without a ticket number, and none of the 3 staff members who I showed it to from 11 am to 1 pm thought to look up the tickets number even though I showed it to them and asked if there was anything else I need to get on board. It was the Alaska airline staff who discovered it as I was boarding. It was Alaska Airline ground staff in Seattle who helped me fix the problem, held the plane for me, and allowed me on board when the incompetent AA staff failed to give a ticket number within the the remaining 30 minutes before boarding closed. 4. I asked AA staff about my luggage which they had taken from me bcs there was no more room in the overhead. They assured me it will be on the flight I board. Again they lied. Again, it was Alaska airline staff who efficiently issued a tracer and kept me informed (thanks Judy of Ontario). They were also the people who delivered my luggage.I travel a lot for work and leisure. This is not the first time a flight was cancelled. Every other time, the airline took care of its passengers e.g. Shuttled them to and from hotels while they arranged a replacement. DFW is AA hub.... And yet they did not provide us with any help.

On June 13, 2014, my husband, a university professor, was invited to present at an international conference in Hartford, Connecticut on August 16th. \u00a0On June 14, 2014, I purchased round-trip tickets for us both through Priceline.com for travel from Los Angeles, California (LAX) to Bradley International Airport (BDL) in Connecticut. Our receipt from Priceline indicates that we had reserved seats for the outgoing flight from LAX to BDL but due to my error, I had not secured seats from BDL to LAX, an oversight I did not become aware of until the day before our outbound flight when I attempted to check-in for the flight 24 hours in advance. I was advised by American Airlines that I did not have reserved seats for my husband and me for either our outbound or returning flights and that we would have to obtain seats at check-in. I explained that my receipt from Priceline showed I had reserved seats, but my efforts to be heard fell on deaf ears. At LAX, my husband and I checked in for our flight and were provided tickets at Row 30, seats A and B, the last row of seating in the plane and arguably the most inconvenient and least comfortable. We each had a carry-on bag, but at the gate were advised that the flight was full and if we were in the third or fourth boarding groups (we were in the fourth) there would not be space for our bags and we were invited to have our bags checked at the gate at no charge. We did so. \u00a0Our 5-hour flight departed at 11:35 pm and was difficult for us both as we are senior citizens and each have health issues. We arrived at our destination exhausted but had to go to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage before being able to get to our hotel for much needed rest. Our return flight was made even worse. When we arrived at the terminal to check-in, the agent assigned us the same row, seats E and F. She then advised us that the flight was full and we should check our two carry-on bags at $25 apiece. She also advised me that my carry-on was too large to be accommodated by the plane's overhead space. I politely explained that I had made dozens of trips with this very bag and had had no difficulty storing it in the overhead bins of every airline I had frequented. She required me to test this by placing the bag in the sample space available in front of the agent's counter. I had some difficulty with this maneuver since, as I mentioned, I am 65 years old, have two artificial knees and only one lung. She forced me to repeat the maneuver multiple times over my protests before being satisfied that the bag would indeed fit. However, she commented that there would still not be room for our bags and that would ultimately result in our having to check the bags anyway. Eventually, in response to my discomfort and growing frustration, I commented to my husband, \"this is sh***y\" at which point, the agent advised me that I had no need to curse. I assure you, as an English major many moons ago, if I wanted to curse, I could have employed more substantial language. We arrived at the gate and although it was a full flight, there was ample space for both my husband and me to store our carry-on bags. By this time, however, I was in significant pain due to the unnecessary stress placed on my knees by having to lift and maneuver my rolling bag into the sample slot. During the flight, my husband dropped his eyeglasses. Due to the tightly packed seating, we were unable to look beneath the seats to find them and had to wait until all other passengers had deplaned. The flight attendants demonstrated significant impatience with us for lingering to look for his prescription eyeglasses and only grudgingly offered to assist us. In so doing, they removed trash that was stashed behind the seats. They had to resort to removing the seat cushions in order to spot the glasses which were underneath the seat and retrieved them for us. As we left the plane, the last passengers to do so, the attendants on board appeared impatient and insensitive to our situations. Basically, the feeling we both derived from the experience was \"don't let the door hit you on the way out.\" My husband and I fly frequently for our work and for pleasure. We used to fly frequently on American Airlines but over the years we have tried other airlines and prefer their prices, comfort, treatment, and amenities. We traveled on American because basically it was the shortest distance between the two points relevant to our circumstances.

(LAX). \u00a0If this is true, it is a terrible rule. It traumatizes a child and leave parents/guardians extremely upset. \u00a0My daughter asked Ms. Wendy what if the child was aged five? \u00a0 She was told in a very rude tone of voice that they \"would not be traveling alone without an adult\".I am a 78-year-old great grand mother of 10 and I know that children travel all the time and in the past they are escorted by their parent/guardian to the gate and a flight attendant usually is assigned to them. \u00a0When they reach their destination they are safely handed over to the waiting parent/guardian. It is incomprehensible to me that any airline or any airport for that matter, would adopt such a rule. \u00a0It was devastating to us and especially to my great granddaughter. \u00a0Since no one at American seemed to care, and we did not want her to miss her flight, we asked a TSA agent to help us, and he was very helpful. \u00a0He asked us why we didn't get a visitors pass and my daughter told him we were denied one and why. \u00a0He said he had never heard of that rule. Usually people get a visitors pass in this situation. \u00a0He was nice enough to take her as far as security and we kept in touch with her by texting.When she got to security she texted us that the personnel was very rude to her about taking off her shoes (she had on sandals with two straps). The first TSA agent told her she did not have to take her shoes off but when she got to the security door? She was told to remove her shoes. \u00a0She had already sent her basket down and was told, \"that's why we have extra ones. \u00a0Go get another and get back in line\". \u00a0Needless to say, she was very upset and confused at the way she was being treated.When she finally got to Chicago and was with her father, she texted her mother that that was the worst experience she has ever had in her whole life and she never wanted to fly on an airplane again. At any rate, it probably would not be on American Airlines.I feel that by writing this letter someone will look into this situation and if this is American Airlines policy, you will work to change it so that the rules are child friendly and parents will know they are safe when flying. \u00a0It is hard enough when a child's parents live in different states and they have to travel long distances to visit them. I hope that I will hear from you soon. \u00a0I am very concerned about my great granddaughter because she will be flying home in a week or so. \u00a0Please give this your immediate attention."}, {"count": 3447, "date": "1/25/2015", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Honestly, how many times can you harass a person about carry on size? \u00a0But then I found out why. \u00a0Totally inappropriate size aircraft to fly across country. \u00a0On this 737, I measured 12\" between my head and the back of the seat in front of me. \u00a0To put my purse under the seat, I had to forego putting my feet there. \u00a0The seatback pocket could not accommodate both a bottle of water AND a book. \u00a0And there was no way I could open a laptop.The flight attendants were rude and the flight was delayed (after boarding I'd for a 5.5 hour flight, of course(, just as my last 4 flights on American.Simply put, this is a terrible airline. \u00a0I hope my business stood sending me on this airline.

Years ago flying from Orlando to Sacramento they left us stranded in Phoenix and offered no assistance whatsoever. We literally watched them put our luggage on the plane as they slammed the door in our face and said sorry it's to late and left us stranded in Phoenix with 2 young kids without our luggage. Thank god for Southwest, we were able to buy tickets to get home the same day. All they offered after we contacted their customer service was a voucher for future flights, no refund for the flight they failed to let us board. \u00a0 So this experience was just as horrific! Except worse! Our departure from Sacramento was scheduled for early morning so we decided to stay at a hotel to be closer and allow us extra time. When we arrived they informed us the plane had hit a bird while landing which I completely understand is out of their control. The way they handled things were where the disaster began. There was clearly no sense of urgency from the ground crew to inspect or repair anything, no repairs were needed. None the less delayed for 2 hours made our connection to Flagstaff impossible. When we asked to get on the next flight we were informed by another non-caring American Airlines employee that the rest of the flights for the day were full so they could only get us there the next morning. For a 30 minute flight we opted to rent a car and drive so we wouldn't loose any more of our already shortened weekend time with our daughter.

The lady who took my ticket let me know this wasn't my flight. I said to the rude boisterous lady \"This isn't my flight.\"Miss Perez stopped what she was doing \u00a0got on her phone and called someone. I decided not to sit down just in case this ended up turning into a seen. I stood to the side. 5 minutes later \u00a0a man name William Wilkins walks over to me he said \" \u00a0Your not getting on any flight out of here\". I asked why? William said \"because you knew your bag was too big to get on this flight\". If I knew it was too large I wouldn't have bought it. Why are you trying to cause a seen?You work for American airline you shouldn't treat your customers this way. He said I don't work for American Airlines, I work for tsa and you are in violations of an FAA penal code. I told him I been at this airport since 7:15am, seen 2 different desk clerks, 2 manager, walked passed two check point at tsa and no one told me that my carry on was big. He said you are going to pay for your carry on or your not flying. I told him no I'm not paying for another suitcase. He asked me for my name and I gladly showed it to him. He said \"I'm going to make sure you never fly out of here again.\"I sat down and waited on my flight. When I looked up there was 2 guards standing in front me. They let me know that they were called \u00a0down here because the manager insisted that I pay for my bag. I said to them this isn't right. If you look around at the other people bags in this terminal \u00a0some of their bags are as big as mine or longer. Why was I singled out amongst all these people? I told them that my bag is adjustable. Can they please show me where I can find the bag measure. When I got there I put my bag in \u00a0it. \u00a0The tip of the bathroom light fixture in my bag make it stick out a bit. I told him to feel the bag and he will see that's what needs to be taken out. I took it out and it slid in with ease. He said Mr. William Wilkins still want you to pay for the bag or leave the airport. I told them that this was just wrong and I just wanted my money back. They showed me where to go. While walking there I seen Mr. William Wilkins. He was talking with another employee. I decided not to interrupt. I walked over to look at his name tag. \u00a0He turned around and said \" Are you sure you can spell my name? I'll give you my card so you can spell my name correctly.\" I let him know \u00a0what he said is unnecessary and I was not illiterate. He mumbled something while I walked away. I turned around and asked him what he said but he wouldn't repeat it. \u00a0I told him that the way he dealt with me today was not necessary. Your suppose to be a professional but you dealt with this situation like a hog. You guys singled me out out of everyone, tried to belittle me in front of the other passengers, tell me your going to black list me, call security on little old me and tried to extort money from me. \u00a0I told him to look at that mans carry on next to him. It's bigger then mine and you didn't say a word to him. There are any people in here but I was targeted. I asked him why me and not them and he walked away.Went down stairs explained what happened. I was so upset I started to cry. When he looked in the computer they changed the complaint to my bag was too heavy. I showed the man what I had in it and that it was adjustable. We weight it, fit it in the bag check, and took pictures. Missed my 10:55pm flight.When I got to the counter Miss. Perez wouldn't look me. When it was my turn she gave me to another agent. Then she walked to where they was taking tickets. Lady gets to the ticket lady and Mr. Perez didn't tell her her bag was too big. The lady taking the ticket said to her \"If you would like we can check that for free for you.\"An option that wasn't offered to me. An Hispanic lady went to Miss. Perez with the same carry on bag as me but in a different color, duffle, and large handbag. Also let her pass with her bags for free. The lady who helped me did ask if I wanted to check my bag for free.American Airline this isn't the way to treat your customers. I fly with Jet Blue and Virgin America .

I really didn't mind the delay at all because I knew that there was nothing that they could have done, what is done is done. But were there not any protocol to check the plane before letting passenger board the airplane? We sat there for a hour before they told us that everyone have to leave the airplane because they couldn't fix it and they need to give us a new airplane. So our flight was supposed to depart at 6:30 a.m. but we did not depart until 8:30 a.m. \u00a0We got back on the plane and sit there for another hour because there was some \"computer glitches.\" Obviously, we missed our connecting flight. Once we landed in Dallas to try to catch our connecting flight that we already missed, the staff handed us some new boarding pass to our new connecting flight which was a thumb up. But wait, that wasn't it. They gave us the wrong boarding pass, because while my husband and I waited for our plane to get boarded, we heard over the intercom, \"Last call for (our names) to Santa Ana.\" My husband and I look at each other and was confuse on why do another flight have our names instead of the flight we were supposed to get on by the boarding pass the staff hand out to us. Well, we couldn't complain because it was an earlier flight or we will have to wait for another hour, but we were really concern about our baggages. When we arrived to Santa Ana, we did got our baggages, so that was maybe one thing that AA did right. On our flight back home, everything was going well. The flight were on time, no delays, we didn't have any problem. But once we arrive to Phoenix for our connecting flight, there were some problems. When I handed that staff my boarding pass, I couldn't board, because I \"did not check in.\" EXCUSE ME?! If I did not check in, how did I arrived to Phoenix from California? And how did I have my boarding pass in my hand? My mother in law and husband is checked in and able to board, but I wasn't able to when we obviously all checked in together. Obviously AA is horrible with delay, so they obviously bump me off the flight and give my seat to someone else that flight was delay. My husband was not having it, after throwing a little scene, they offered to give me a $500 voucher and a hotel room. Of course, I was not having it, time could not be bought. But thankfully another passenger volunteer to stay so I could take their seat. But it's ridiculous how my seat was given to someone else and they overbooked the flight.

OK, getting a little annoyed now. Waited another hour or so before they told us there was no flight until tomorrow. Got in line at customer service for hotel vouchers. Maybe over 100 passengers and 2 people working the counter. It takes about 4 hours to reach the front. The woman that helped us was freaking out and rude. A couple of passengers didn't get vouchers btw. They tell us next flight is at 7am and it was already past midnight. We opted to sleep at the airport. Morning rolls around and flight is canceled again. Next flight is noon. We go to customer service to complain. Woman there working on the 31st of Dec tells us \"if you're all going to make a fuss then get out.\" We see her in line at Dunkin Donuts 10 minutes later. Noon rolls around and we board the flight. Another delay because the co-pilot is not there yet. 40 mins later, he finally shows and we managed to leave. We arrive in Japan over a day later, missed NYE (celebrated in the sky), and lost out a night in our hotel. I filed a claim with AA.com and to this day, no response.

Just before they closed the doors one of the gate crew came up to us and asked to see our boarding passes. We gave them to her. She then asked to see our itinerary, which we showed her. Then she said you aren't ticketed for this flight. Huh? Then how did we get boarding passes? She never really answered that question, just said it didn't matter because we weren't listed on the flight and had to get off the plane. Of course we wanted to try to clear this up, but she wasn't interests in hearing what we had to say, and became more insistent that we get off the plane or she would call security. It felt like we'd gone from being preferred customers to criminals. We got off, so that the other passengers, our luggage, and two empty first class seats could go to Kauai with out us. A couple of hours later after discovering that American had made some sort of error, we were stuffed into the back of a full flight without so much as an apology.And although the mistake was made by American, the Hawaiian Airlines gate crew was inconsiderate and at times rude. It was not a good way to start a vacation!Final message: Beware of airlines pretending to be customer friendly and don't do them any favors..... they won't do you any!"}, {"count": 3688, "date": "6/19/2016", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Now that we are home safely from St. Thomas, the American territory in the Virgin Islands, I feel the need to explain what I meant by \"The trip from Hell,\" since so many wonderful people were innocently involved in organizing and participating in this trip to make sure we had a great time and are definitely not responsible for the \"hell\" we went through with American Airlines. First of all and most importantly, I want to thank my fabulous husband, Honey Dick, for working so hard this past year to qualify for this trip to St. Thomas, as he does every year so that we get to experience wonderful adventures with Forward Strategies, the company who works with my husband everyday to support my husband's business needs. In addition, I want to mention all the lovely people we met on our trip who traveled with us, as well as, all the people who live and/or work on the two islands we visited, St. Thomas and St. John, they were the loveliest, warmest and most giving people I've ever met! However, American Airlines took all that away by making what would have been a great experience into a pure travel hell. Our scheduled 5 hour and 19 minute trip from LAX to Miami and a easy connection in Miami to St. Thomas of only 2 hour and 43 minutes turned into 24 hours of travel hell. Two hours into our flight to Miami we started having cabin pressure problems so the pilot kept us at a very low altitude which caused us to experience tremendous turbulence forcing us to land in Dallas and delaying us enough to miss our connection in Miami for St. Thomas. So by the time we arrived in Miami it was about 10 pm, instead of our scheduled 5:00 pm. landing and we found ourselves standing in LONG lines trying to get a voucher to enable us to stay for free in a hotel for the night but WITHOUT OUR LUGGAGE because of SECURITY REASONS. They did give us a small packet of toothpaste and a very thin brush, designed mainly for people with no teeth and a $12.00 per person voucher for dinner and a $7.00 per person voucher for breakfast in the airport the next morning. We did get on a later flight the next day, Friday, but arrived so late in the day, we were 45 minutes late to the social drinks and dinner with the rest of the 50 people who arrived the day before. A lot of people felt sorry for us but we were thankful this whole episode was over and we could enjoyed the next 6 days. Well, I wish this story was over but it's not. On our last day in St. Thomas, we left the hotel at 12:30 pm and 24 hours later we made it home in LA....because the whole thing happened again! Once again there were mechanical problems with this American Airlines' plane we were to board at 3:45 pm in St. Thomas for Miami....(Again we were going to miss our connecting flight from Miami to LAX)... so we waited in long lines once more, made phone calls to travel agents who were out of town and called Customer Service people at American Airlines to help find us a connecting flight from Miami to LAX as soon as possible BUT there wasn't anything available until 7:25 am the next morning out of Miami. Once again we were going to be stuck in Miami without our luggage. So we left St. Thomas at 9:25 pm that night, arriving in Miami at 1:00 am, no luggage, no food or a place to sleep and again we were STANDING IN A LINE FOR ONE HOUR to get another hotel voucher, another $12.00 dinner voucher (which was too late to use because everything was closed) and our $7.00 voucher for breakfast the next morning. Not to mention the free tooth brush and tooth paste they gave us for our teeth. When we finally got a hotel room at 2 am we only had time to sleep until 5 am and once again start our rush to the Miami airport to catch our final flight to LAX at 7:25 am. We were scheduled to arrive in LA around 9:30 am, which we did, however, when we landed and taxi'd to our gate the pilot got on the speaker to tell us that we couldn't get off because there was another plane in our parking spot and we'd have to wait. So we waited a hour on the tarmac until the pilot finally decided to DRIVE the plane to the Tom Bradley International part of LAX and dropped us off there. Unfortunately, the pilot neglected to tell us that our luggage was left at the domestic gate and we'd have to walk all the way back which took us 45 minutes.

I felt sorry for one mother trying to board with an infant. AA does not board passengers with children ahead of the others. This is the first airline I've seen who don't board children first...SMH.In-flight, the only complimentary are select beverages, it was a 4H-long flight so they serve food for purchase. They no longer accept cash, only debit or credit. The flight attendants kept announcing passengers can check the in-flight food menu...a menu that's nowhere to be found, even by the flight attendants, you won't know how much is the food you're ordering not until you ordered..I didn't order so I can't give any review on the food and price.During the flight they showed Sherlock Holmes and you can purchase a headset for $2...but don't bother watching an all-purple-hued screen and listening to a buzzing sound all throughout the movie. During the flight, passengers line up outside the lavatories...I thought that's no longer allowed by TSA. There were a couple of passengers in the back crew cabin standing and chatting most of the flight, except when the seatbelt light turns on then they rush back to their seats to buckle-up. These people must be AA employees availing their travel benefits as I see them giving massages to some of the flight attendants.

But American Airlines is SO BAD and I feel like I need to write about my experiences with them. Now, I've heard horror stories about AA which is why I avoid flying with them as much as possible. For the most part, when I do fly with American, my experience with them is mediocre at best. However, the last two trips I have flown with them have been so horrible. This past summer I was flying to New Orleans and American Airlines cancelled my flight without any proper notification. After I was on the phone for several hours with them, the customer service representative \"booked\" me on a flight for the day after my original travel day. Fine, I was able to work with that. But after never getting my confirmation and several more hours on the phone with American Airlines, I find out the the representative I spoke to never booked my on the appropriate flight and I had to change my flight once again. After I submitted a complaint, American Airlines sent me that generic apology they send everyone and a $200 voucher. So then I decide to use the voucher to travel during the holiday season. At the start of my trip I got to the American Airlines terminal and walk into a disaster. There was no structured line at the check in kiosks and the employees were doing nothing to organize the mayhem. At least a third of the kiosks were broken as well (remember, this is around Christmas, which is obviously a very busy travel time). Eventually I make it to my destination (I'll also mention that American Airlines planes are disgusting. My seat had a lot of crumbs on the chair and the aisle looked like it hadnt been cleaned between flights). My next problem was that about an hour before I was about to head to the airport to catch a flight back home 2 days after Christmas, my parents called me to tell me that they looked at the status of my flight and and it was cancelled. So yet again, American Airlines cancelled my flight and did not even bother to call or email me. My fiance, who was also traveling with me, did not get a notification either. We called AA and had to wait 2 hours on the phone before speaking to a human being to figure out our trip back home. Eventually we got placed on the flight for the next day, which meant that the both of us would be missing a day of work. We finally got on the flight back home the next day. Once again, the seats were filthy (I'm really not nitpicky at all. I get it, these seats get dirty. But it looks like they didnt even bother to clean up any extra trash or food wastes left behind). We had also paid extra for premium seats since my fiance is very tell and needs that extra legroom. These seats were no bigger than the rest of the plane though. The last straw was when we got back home to Philadelphia and found out that AA lost our luggage. \u00a0We did not see our checked bag (full of Christmas gifts) come out on the carousel, but we did notice the employees were carelessly grabbing all the bags on the carousel and piling them on each other. We searched every pile and asked several employees about our bag. Every single employee just told us to go look for our bags in the mess they created. One went as far as to say \"can you see with your eyes? Ok then look for your bags\". Absolutely unprofessional. It really does take alot for me to completely cross a company off my list like that (and even more for me to write a bad yelp review), but I've already had two horrible experiences in a row with AA and not a single good experience with them to make up for it. I will not be flying with them ever again, no matter how many vouchers they throw my way, and I highly recommend no one flies with them. tl;dr aka the short version: American airlines has already cancelled two of my flights without notifying me, lost my luggage and the employees were completely apathetic, and their flights are very uncomfortable and unclean."}, {"count": 3721, "date": "6/7/2016", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Suck the worst branch of flight!

On July 7th, we checked in at 5:00 p.m. for our 5:57 p.m. flight LAS to (LAX) then connecting to CUN. \u00a0We were delayed due to no flight crew was available to fly due to exceeded hours which put our flight departure at 7:45 p.m. \u00a0This should not be the passenger's fault it is poor planning on AA's part. \u00a0Then we had another delayed departure for 8:25 p.m., 9:20 p.m. and 9:35 p.m. which when we finally boarded the flight, there was mechanical issues which pushed our departure time and 10:00 p.m. arriving in to LAX at 11:24 p.m. missing our connecting flight to CUN which was to arrive at 6:00 a.m. on Saturday, July 8th.

I am originally from Honduras residing in New Orleans and decided to travel with American Airlines to go home for the holidays. My flight connection from Miami to San Pedro Sula, Honduras was every flyer's nightmare. In short, lets just say from the moment I sat down in the plane at 6 10 pm, I did not take off Miami until 9 10 pm. The original delay issue happened because the plane was overfueled. Understandable, however 1 hour 35 min of delay? Not so understandable. The iffy thing about it was that the pilot failed to give us any time estimate more than a mere \"until further notice\". One would think that such a standard, unemergent issue would have at least a range of time estimate but nothing. After that hour and a half of waiting, the flight attendant started passing out custom papers to very discomforted passengers. One in particular was very upset and started being loud with his words when the flight attendant approached him. He started telling her that the treatment we were getting was really unfair. His story was that his original flight was at 11 am and, because he missed it for 3 minutes, he payed $800 to get on this flight that wouldn't even give us water or anything for the inconvenience or even a time estimate as to when was he finally going to get home. This lead to a discussion which lead to her storming out of the conversation. A few minutes later another attendant came by threatening him. She said that it was to his convenience to stay calm and quiet or else he was going to get kicked out of the plane. Her berating words only helped to add fuel to his fire, because he only went on and on about his already terrible flight experience and how he was not being a threat or nuisance to anybody, he stressed the fact that he was just saying what was on everyone's mind, which was true. This flight attendant stormed off as well and I overheard one attendant tell the other that the decision was up to her. I thought, this may be enough to kick him out under any other circumstance, but surely if this is up to the flight attendant and she knows how much we have been delayed at this point, nothing more than a warning would come out of it. I had never been so mistaken. Around 20 minutes later the pilot announces further delays because a passenger will be escorted out of the plane. Another 25 minutes later, after he gets escorted out, the pilot announces that now they are going to start unloading the bags to find his bag and that the flight would be further delayed until further notice. We saw through the window how they took out all of the bags from both sides of the plane until they finally found his. This was the lengthiest process of the wait, taking about 45 minutes to do. Murmurs started and everyone was incredibly mad at American Airlines. No one could see why 100+ passengers were being obliged to sit in that same spot for that long without notice or any consideration over 1 passenger. Some people had ways to go still to get to their final destination. Some people (including me) had very little to eat because we were waiting to be received home by our loved ones with homemade food. The general consensus was that this was to show that the policies in place make for a very unreliable flight; traveling with AA was a mistake they will never make again. No clear waiting time, no refreshments, not even any freedom to get up, what else could go wrong? I specifically remember that at the point the pilot announced that they would start searching for his bag, the flight crew was relaxing and drinking water in front of our faces while we were all dying! It was not until the very lat 25 min of the wait that they decided to pass on a cup of water and a granola bar to everyone. This has to be the biggest low of the whole flight. It was amazing how completely inconsiderately the whole thing was handled. As I said, I sat down at 6 10 pm and the flight did not leave until exactly 3 hours later were i was strongly suggested to stay seated the whole time; I was of the last people to get in the plane even so people had been sitting there way longer than I had. The actual flight was 2 hours so a total of 5 hours sitting on that plane. I do believe that there are policies in place for this sort of thing but if a flight attendant had the choice not to make 100+ people go through this terrible experience and she still did so, I am very disappointed at AA's policy structure and the lack of reliability is something I had never seen anywhere else and do not wish to experience ever again."}, {"count": 3806, "date": "8/18/2016", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "I have NEVER had so many problems with an airline before.

By now our connecting flight to Rio was long gone so we were told by the gate attendant that we would have to stay 2 nights at the Motel 6 in Dallas instead of in our nice suite on Ipanema Beach (prepaid/non-refundable). 2 nights because AA does not fly DFW-RIO on Sundays. So we were given vouchers for Motel 6 and McDonalds. We pleaded with the attendant to somehow re-route us to Rio. When she found us to be less than thrilled with our revised vacation plans, she called a security officer who came rolling over on a Segway. He didn't say a word, just rolled back and forth on his elevated perch while sneering menacingly.Later that trip my wife asked for a blanket because it was very cold in the cabin.

My trip was from LA to Chicago and I had a bus to catch to my town from there. What makes missing this bus bad is that there is only one bus that goes every day from Chicago to my place so I would have to wait until 10.45 pm the next day to get on the next one. Apparently due to stormy weather conditions, Chicago airport had already been down and there was some issue with the gates so I was sitting inside a plane on the runway for two whole hours. I had planned my flight such that I would have sufficient time for any delays ,to grab some dinner (I hadn't eaten anything the whole day) and head to my bus station but nope, didn't happen.The frustrating part is here- I was so pissed that I had missed my bus and now had to spend a night in \u00a0Chicago and miss my work for no reason so I wanted to talk to an AA representative. You will not believe when I say I couldn't find a single soul. I asked someone at one of the gates(gate L1), they pointed me to the main kiosk in another gate(K) and long story short ,I walked between these gates three times( mind you,this was a huge stretch as the gates were not next to each other) because I was always pointed to other one. Finally, at K1,they said I will have to go to K2/K3 and I couldn't even find these gates( and trust me ,I tried)!

But I am just so fed up with American Airlines. If I can prevent a paying customer from having terrible service, this review is worth it. So brace yourself! Worst airlines and service. They hold their customers liable for their mistakes. American Airlines first delayed my flight, then ended up cancelling it (while we were on the runway) due to a fail in service as they exceeded a time allotment. If AA was even the least bit diligent, this situation would have never happened. \u00a0When it came to rescheduling my flight, I explained that I am going to London for my cousin's wedding. However,they were only giving me flights that had a lay over which arrive in London late morning/afternoon time. Which means I would've missed the wedding (the sole reason for my travel). After awhile I became fed up. Only after being a bit aggressive, I was rescheduled for a flight to land in London at 5:10 am but meant I also have a layover in Boston. I originally paid extra to have a direct flight and upgraded to economy plus for my comfort. However, I was given a flight that was delayed, then cancelled which was compensated with another flight that had a 3 hour layover, 10 hours later then my original flight (definitely not what I paid for).Because of this whole situation, I literally have to leave the airport and go straight to the wedding once I land in London. A wedding that I have been looking forward to and that I traveled all the way to London for. Now I have to attend this spectacular wedding without the chance to look the part. Keep in mind I land in London at 5:10 am on 3/26, but have been at LAX since 5 pm 3/24. Since I now have to resort to going straight to the wedding for the airport, I asked if I could have a hotel voucher or if there were facilities in the airport where I could freshen up during my layover in Boston. The supervisor Toni said there is a lounge at LAX, but I wouldn't be able to use it due to a shortage of time as he believes it opens around 6 am \u00a0(when it actually opens at 4:30 am) and my flight's boarding time is 6:25 am. So he said to check out the lounge in the Boston Airport as I have a 3 hour lay over which is plenty of time to freshen up. When I went to go follow up with what was told to me, one representative stated that I couldn't receive a hotel voucher in Boston until I reach Boston (which is false). Then I spoke to another representative (that was refreshingly caring). She stated Toni gave me information that was false in regards to the lounge and that in fact if I need a hotel voucher for Boston, I can request it now at LAX. But because I was offered something (even though the lounge is for members only) she will try to honor what was told to me. So she told me her manager will be by shortly. The manager Stephanie didn't even take the time to hear what I had to say. She stated that she couldn't honor what Toni stated as Toni didn't document anything regarding the situation \u00a0and that she couldn't verify this was true as he had already left. So apparently their word has no value. They didn't take into consideration what was told to me, their mistake and the over all situation. No compassion for their passengers whatsoever. When I walked away, the MANAGER Stephanie laughed at me with another agent in regards to wanting a hotel voucher for a few hours in order to freshen up. \u00a0Great customer service and care right? Worst of all, I asked numerous times to please be upgraded as I would like \u00a0what I paid for. I paid extra with my original flight to relax and to actually be comfortable. And after all the trouble and hardship AA staff provided, the LEAST they could do is upgrade my seats. But before I can be compensated by an upgrade for an error made on AA's behalf, I must email AA guest relations versus dealing with the matter directly with an agent. How does it even make sense to email guest services versus dealing with the matter right away? \u00a0You know, I never thought AA could be so terrible as in the past, I never had to go through anything like this. But I am never going to make the mistake of flying with AA again. I would much rather take my business some where else where customers are appreciated and cared for.

First, the Chicago flight was delayed by two hours for no apparent reason. Initially, I received a phone call about three hours before my flight from an AA auto-attendant to inform me that the plane would depart 30 minutes late. No big deal, right? And I much appreciated the advance notice. But then I arrived at LAX, and learned that the flight had been delayed another 30 minutes. Again, not a huge deal. Until the time on the \"departure\" board kept creeping later.... and later.... and later. With no apology or explanation. There was no mechanical failure, the crew simply hadn't been able to \"turn around\" the plane quickly enough. No apology. No offer of free food on board. Nothing. I ended up getting into O'Hare at 1:30 am, rather than the original 11:30 pm. In this case, two hours made the difference between my being picked up by my uncle and mom upon arrival, and my having to shell out $40 for a cab ride to my hotel. To top it all off, I asked the gate agent why my boarding pass wasn't labeled \"Priority AAcess,\" since I am an AA credit card holder, and my boarding pass on my last trip (to Ecuador) was so labeled. The gate agent was rude and dismissive. Then I went to the AA customer service center (right down the hall on the same terminal) and asked the same question, and she was almost as dismissive (and surprisingly ignorant on the subject). Both people referred me to my credit card company for help, e.g. they tried to \"pass the buck.\"Other issues:- No seat-back entertainment system, even on international flights. You have to make do with the movies they play on the tiny screens that drop from the ceilings.- Trying to charge you extra to sit in the same seats farther up in the plane.- Pissy and rude flight attendants. On the Chicago flight, one of them called me out when she \"almost tripped\" on the handle of the little tote bag I'd stowed under the seat in front of me. Like it was intentional. Maybe subconsciously!- At the LAX terminal, good luck finding a single plug for your electronic device. I now have ingrained in my brain the location of every single outlet/ plug that works in the terminal, because unfortunately, there are very few (and the ones that exist are courtesy Samsung's scattered plug-in stations - of which there aren't nearly enough - not AA). I only found one working non-Samsung outlet in the entire terminal, and it was on the floor next to a garbage can, practically in the middle of the main walkway. I kid you not, I spent most of my waiting period next to the garbage can, sitting on my suitcase. - Perpetually late flights- Perpetual technical difficulties, resulting in delays and sometimes canceled flights.

We were really hoping to get those vouchers. After waiting and waiting to find out and after everyone else has boarded, the lady tells us, \"I'm sorry but we wont be using you two. But we can upgrade you to first class and I will buy both of you wine or champagne.\" Damn right, you better upgrade us. *smh*I will never fly American Airlines again. If I do, it is because I had no choice. I still can't get over the baggage fee they charged. It was my fault because I should have researched before I booked my vacation package. I am a JetBlue girl. No baggage fee. The check in is quick. They provide entertain on the plane no matter where you are going. I still get nervous about flying therefore I need a tv in front of me to shut off my brain from the nervous thoughts I have. Sitting on an AA plane, you hear all the rickety noises from the plane.

American Airlines cancelled a flight due to improper scheduling of pilots. I had to forfeit a hotel stay and possible job opportunity. I unfortunately chose to fly American Airlines for business on July 18th, 2015. Since I was supposed to arrive that night, I had a prepaid hotel booked beginning that night. After sitting on the tarmac in a scorching airplane with a broken air conditioner for almost an hour because \"paperwork\" was being processed, our flight was cancelled. The very transparent pilot informed us that he had surpassed his allotted flight hours for a 24 period and was unable to fly us to our destination. Now, I booked my flight over a month in advance, so if I knew I was flying how is it that American Airlines didn't find the time to properly assign a pilot to that flight. Now if that pilot would have taken off on time, he would have surpassed his hours mid flight, so would we have had to make an emergency landing? How am I supposed to feel safe ever flying an American Airlines flight again, knowing they work their pilots to the very last hour? Needless to say, we had to rebook our flight. I had a job training to get to the next morning at 8 am. American Airlines did not have another available flight to Denver that night. Now not only was this an enormous inconvenience for me, but their customer service was completely unhelpful and incompetent when I called after waiting in the rebooking line for another hour. Even though I told them I didn't mind being separated from my wife multiple times in order to get to my job on time, they could not figure out a way to book us on separate flights, or to cancel her flight, since it was their fault my trip was cancelled, and send me to Denver on my own. They finally managed to find a flight for the two of us, which turned my two hour, booked at least a month in advance, into a four hour flight with a 6 hour layover. At this point, I have missed a night if sleep, a paid hotel stay, and credibility with my employer because I showed up 4 hours late without sleep. I have contacted American Airlines for a reimbursement on my hotel stay lost, to say the least, considering this cancellation was 100% avoidable with proper scheduling, and 100% their fault.

I originally had a flight at noon and got to the airport with plenty of time, but AA rescheduled the flight for a half hour earlier without notifying me. So when I went to check-in they told me I couldn't get on the plane although they just began boarding. I was originally connecting to Chicago from Charlottesville, VA, but after that I waited standby for two different planes to Charlotte. Eventually they got me a confirmed connection to Philadelphia. I had waited in the airport for 6 hours before I got on this flight, but we had mechanical issues that took an hour to fix - due to this I missed my connecting flight. They told me to go to the customer assistance booth, which was unbelievably under-staffed. It took 2 and a half hours for me to get to the end of it and then they told me they couldn't get me on any flights to Denver for two days, but I have to be back by the latest the next morning due to several reasons (primarily professional, but many personal reasons as well). I decided to try flying back standby the next day where I woke up at 5am in a hotel that I had to pay for (I don't know why they told me they weren't responsible because it is due to weather when in actuality it was due to mechanical issues). I was 5th in standby, which completely baffled me because they put people that just missed their connecting flights in front of me although they caused me to miss my connecting flight the day prior. Eventually, they called my name, which made me unbelievably happy because I had been having the worst traveling experience of my life (and I have traveled a lot!), but once I got on the plane there weren't any seats available so they took me off the flight and apologized. They told me they had two more flights to Denver I could try to make standby 12 hours later and that they could confirm me for a flight late the following night (which absolutely cannot work with my schedule). So I ended up buying the only ticket I could get out of Philadelphia to Denver tomorrow morning. That ticket was $750 and they wouldn't pay for my hotel costs which ended up being a little over $300.

During this time three other planes landed, all of their luggage was sorted out and the passengers from those planes left the terminal. \u00a0 Much to our chagrin that is when we found one of our pieces of luggage was still in Miami. \u00a0Then we had to make the report. \u00a0This made us miss the last two ferries from Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas to Road Town, Tortola. \u00a0We \u00a0then took a harrowing taxi ride to Red Hook, St. Thomas trying to make the very last ferry of the day. \u00a0Thanks to our very ingenious taxi driver we just made it. \u00a0The problem is this taxi ride cost us $50 extra dollars not to mention the 2 \u00a01/2 hours we have lost from our vacation so far. \u00a0 The ferry also cost us ten dollars more per person. \u00a0Since two more of our family met us at the airport, that was eighty extra dollars we have spent because of their incompetence. \u00a0The ferry we had to take from Red Hook was not a direct ferry like the one we would have taken from Charlotte Amalie and \u00a0took an extra half an hour; \u00a0another delay in our vacation caused by them. \u00a0The Virgin Islands is well know for people going between islands and having to make ferries. \u00a0Our flight came in at 3:30pm, originally supposed to land at 2:57pm. \u00a0It is well know that ferries stop running from Charlotte Amalie at 4:30pm. \u00a0American should have done everything in its power to get people on their way, \u00a0even if it meant that we picked up our luggage from a rack that your one person took off the plane \u00a0and put on that rack on the tarmac. \u00a0 We deplaned through stairs so could go right by and grab it. The whole situation was ridiculous. \u00a0At least 1/4 - 1/3 \u00a0of the passengers were in the same situation as us. \u00a0 Four others lost baggage.

First he was informed it would not be delivered to where we were on Tortola; \u00a0we would have to \u00a0make a trip to the ferry terminal to pick it up. \u00a0Then they could not tell him which ferry it would be on. \u00a0We had to wait around 5 hours until we came up with the solution that we would go to the St. John ferry terminal to pick it up. \u00a0Even though there were five ferries that came from Charlotte Amalie to Road Town, Tortola that morning. \u00a0We made it easy on them, to get it to us, by going back to an United States Virgin Island where the ferries ran every hour. \u00a0We were inconvenienced again to fix their errors.Now on to our flight home. \u00a0July 25th, 2015, we arrive at the airport three hours before our flight. \u00a0The six of us were flying from St. Thomas to Philadelphia, PA on flight #837 leaving at 3:05pm. \u00a0We arrived at the airport at 11:45am. \u00a0We went to the kiosk and got our plane tickets and then joined the extremely long line, at \u00a0the ticket counter, \u00a0just to get our luggage tags. We were in that line for 1 \u00a01/2 hours due to there only being one teller working. \u00a0This is more unbelievable ineptitude. In closing, they cost us 130 more \u00a0dollars to get where we were going and \u00a0about ten hours of vacation time for eight people. That might not seem much to you but 80 hours of total lost time ( ten hours times eight people) is a lot of a vacation that has been planned for three years. Their response was an apology letter pretty much saying these things happen. \u00a0I find it hard to believe that I can forget this experience and would be willing to fly American \u00a0again."}, {"count": 4050, "date": "10/26/2014", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "AA is the worst!

The Illuminati symbols on the seat upholstery were enough to convince me that this company is intentionally diabolical. But you know what? Satanists need jobs too and American is there to make sure they stay employed. I would not consider flying an animal or child alone with this carrier. I am pretty sure they would \"disappear\", only to be scarified to the Lord of Darkness. Tragic. So, my hunny and I decided to take a last minute trip to New York for a few days. We didn't want to check any baggage because of the fees and we really didn't need to take a large suitcase with us due to the duration of our stay. So we took our carry-on. Well, everybody else, being cheap bastards like us, decided to do the same thing. Except American didn't enforce their size requirements and make the people ahead of us check their over-sized or extra items. No, they started literally pulling our luggage out of our hands from us and everybody behind us to check them without charging us. So we flew to Chicago and our plane was late, and with only 3 minutes left to spare, we barely boarded our second plane to New York. And that was with us literally running through the airport. And that's when it hit me, I bet our carry on, with all of our stuff, didn't make it onto the plane with us. And in all of my wisdom, I decided to wear sandals on the plane, thinking I would change into my boots and coat once we got to LaGuardia. So we land in NYC, where it's freezing, and raining, and I'm wearing sandals and a t-shirt. I spent the first hour of my stay there trying to figure out where our luggage was and when we would get it. When we got nowhere with the person at the Customer Service desk we decided to go to our hotel and tried calling corporate Customer Service. The woman insisted that she could do NOTHING for us, that was the word she kept repeating, NOTHING, she couldn't tell us when the next plane was coming in, what their lost luggage procedure was, etc... But I knew she was full of shit so after 30 minutes of running around in circles with her I asked for her supervisor. Well her boss tells us there is something she could have/should have done for us, which is offer us a $100.00 credit to go out and buy some clothing. OMFG seriously!? I never used profanity, I was nothing but nice to her and the idiot didn't want to offer me a credit? Maybe I should have been a complete intimidating bitch and I would have gotten further with her a lot sooner. So the supervisor tells us to save our receipts and present them to the Service counter at LAX when we get back. We are elated, so we head out to Lord and Taylor and pick up some boots, gloves, and a sweater, making sure to hold onto our receipts for dear life. Our luggage finally arrives at 3AM that night and we're good to go.... The trip is great, I'm fighting sniffles from not having proper footwear in 33 degree weather, but who cares?

I flew Los Angeles to Guatemala and back on another airline. That part of my trip was great. I met with my family in Guatemala to travel to Puerto Rico. We had to go from Guatemala to Florida to Puerto Rico, then back the same way, and this lousy airline would not give us seats together during any portions of the trip. I paid $1,076 per ticket several weeks before the trip and could not get this crappy airline to give us seats together. We were 3 family members on vacation sitting in different seats, rows or sections of the plane. Then when it was time to leave Puerto Rico, some useless AA employee wanted to see my return ticket from Guatemala to Los Angeles prior to giving me a boarding pass. I told him I did not have that with me. He would not check me in without it or the confirmation # for the Guatemala trip. I told him that the Los Angeles/Guatemala portion of my trip was with another airline and was not AA's business or concern. He said that it was company rules and he needed confirmation that I will be leaving Guatemala. I said that my leaving or staying in Guatemala for as long as I wanted was no one else's concern. It was bizarre. This guy was an absolute idiot. He did not know what he was doing, and was delaying my check in. Finally after much struggling, another counter person was able to help me. When it was time to leave, we just waited and waited and finally our flight started boarding with a delay of over 30 some minutes. After about an hour in flight, I mentioned to a flight attendant that was walking by that we had a connecting flight to catch, and she abruptly yelled at me saying \"we were only delayed a few minutes, big deal\" and walked away. What an angry b**ch.

The plane arrived late into San Antonio for my flight #AA338 which than arrived late to DFW at gate A28 at 4:11 ( instead of 4:00). Our stewardess announced the gates for all connectors stating mine was gate B2. I got off the plane (infront of other customers in order to not miss my flight # AA2463 to LAX) \u00a0and ran to the Sky link to gate B2 only to be told that I needed to be at gate C2. Again I ran as fast as I could because there were many handicap carts but no drivers, the workers said that they did not have keys to the carts sitting in your entire A,B & C terminals at 4:15 in the afternoon! \u00a0When I finally got to gate C2,(15 minutes before takeoff) I found the doors closed and me with several other passengers who needed to be on the same flight. There I stand dripping in sweat and red faced trying to catch my breathe and speak at the same time!!! A mechanic saw us and went to tell the counter attendants we were waiting to board. Me and a Platinum member were met by two rude and condescending boarding agents proceeded to scold us inferring that we lying to them about being at the gate 15 minutes before the boarding ends. And flatly telling us we cannot board our flight!!! It was obvious that I had been running and when I asked Traci Gwaltney #549019 why she gave my seat away on flight # AA2463, she looked at my boarding pass and said, \"Oh you are Redman, we were calling for you\". I told her I was in the airport and did not hear my name called at all!!! \u00a0Then I asked if she would put me on the next flight in first class for the trouble, and she laughed at me???She proceeded to tell me,\" that it was my fault that I was not on the flight and that I had more than enough time to get to the gate on time!!!!\"Then she handed me a form, putting me on \"Stand by\" for flight #AA2459??? I asked her why she was not \u00a0 giving me a seat and she just laughed to my face and handed me the paper? I said to her, \"this is not funny why are you laughing\" and she replied, \"Yes it really is funny\"!!!! Then I asked to speak to a supervisor, and she said she would call one. \u00a0Traci continued to stand there and give me a rude look as her partner, Donna Cain #452323 then looked at me and yelled at me, \"A supervisor has been called\" 4 separate times in front of \u00a0additional passengers who were being denied boarding on the same flight due to our flight being late arriving??? I asked her to lower her voice and she refused!!!! \u00a0As supervisor, Darrell Glenn #599253 approached gate C2 to talk to me, Traci ran up to him to give him her story before I could tell him how rude and senseless she was to me. \u00a0He than approached me and when I started telling him what I had just experienced he walked me down to counter C3, (all the time my plane was still sitting at the gate not going anywhere)???? Darrell proceeded to give me a seat (instead of the Stand By that Traci gave me) on flight #AA2459 leaving from gate C36. He apologized for the middle seat and called down to gate (C36) to see if the agents could save a open window or aisle seat for me if it came available. Then he summoned a cart to drive me to the gate since I was still red faced, sweating and about to pass out by this point. When I got to the counter I asked if there was a possibility of changing my seat in which although it was still a middle seat, it had \u00a0been moved up to business with a little more legroom. Thank you! \u00a0hy could Darrell Glenn give me a seat and Traci Gwaltney could only place me on standby???Why would I and other passengers lie about getting to the gate 15 minutes before boarding ended? What makes it acceptable for a boarding agent to laugh at a customer who is in distress???? Then flight #AA2459 was to take off at 5:40pm but the tower and the pilots could not get their act together on what runway we should takeoff from so a full plan sat on the tarmac until 6:15pm baking in the hot plane before taking off? ???? Passengers were asking for glasses of water due to the hot temperature and profuse sweating by all on the plane. \u00a0I was already so sweaty from all the running I had to do that my seat back was wet during my entire flight!!! \u00a0Is this the new American Airlines???? You made people sit for 5 hours on the tarmac at LAX this week in route to Las Vegas and the plane ran out of water and again people roasted in the hot plane??? \u00a0I travel on AA for all my business, (on average 3 times a month) and am now having second thoughts about my next trip this month."}, {"count": 4171, "date": "4/12/2013", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "review": "Get food in the main terminal.

I go over to the gate and the board says the flight was cancelled. \u00a0So i get in line like all the other folks and again no information as to what to do or why is was cancelled.

Even like a tablet and a remote printer where they can look up what went wrong and reprint something would save everyone time. You are making your workers hate their jobs.

When I asked the representatives at the gate in Orlando, they said that it was indeed the same flight. When my friend called the customer service center on 7/31, the day before our flight, the representative had also said that it was one flight and that we would stay on the same plane in Dallas. As it turns out, our flight from Orlando to Dallas got delayed more than an hour and we arrived at Dallas at approximately 5:50 PM instead of 5:15 like originally scheduled. My friends and I were initially not worried because the flight attendant said to stay on the plane in the same seat to go to LA. Well, shortly after we landed we found out that 2280 was actually two separate flights and that the second flight had already left. Everyone on the first 2280 flight missed the connection because we were all told that it was the same flight, and thus did not book an alternate flight after our flight from Orlando got delayed. The Dallas representative only gave me two choices at first: fly the next morning or go to Ontario, CA. She didn't even offer standby, which I had to ask for. I was then put on standby for hours.

I called AA several times to get someone to try to ensure he got help getting to his gate since its at a different concourse or give me local Miami contact number.

Today's experience was the worst I had in years. At 11am I get dropped off at LAX to catch my 12pm flight to Las Vegas and see American Airlines counter. Left side says \"Group Check-in\", right says \"Main Cabin\". Figuring out I need Main Cabin, I get in line. There is only 1 agent helping. After awhile, second agent joined. When I reach the counter to check-in and to check-in my bag, lady says: \"You have missed the deadline to check-in your bag\". I look at a clock; it is 11:20 am! Deadline to check-in luggage is 45 minutes which means I was standing in that line for 20 minutes, missed the deadline by 5 minutes, and agents would not try to speed things up. I remember two times my luggage was late a few minutes in a similar situation while flying Alaska and Southwest. Both times agents checked in bags and said that they will do their best to get those on the plane but they will not guarantee they will arrive on time. I can definitely say that was a much better customer service than the one I got on American Airlines. All I got from an American Airlines agent is that I have an option of carrying it on board by the route of \"throwing all the regular-sized toiletries out\" . Not the thing you are hoping to hear when you are traveling. Furthermore, agent has refused to put me on my 12 pm flight. Her next suggestion? She can put me on a 3pm as a stand-by or confirm my seat on a 5pm flight to the tune of a $75 fee! I took the stand-by and checked-in my bag, another $25 fee. Standing there I could not help myself but think about all the times I have flown with Alaska (I am a frequent flyer) and Southwest - I have never got charged to be confirmed on a later flight nor did I ever got charged for checking in 1 bag. And I got a much friendlier customer service! Before, I thought that their flights are simply convenient. After getting a bad customer service from American Airlines, I came to realize that Southwest and Alaska do things better, sans $125 in fees.At that point, I have politely explained to the American Airlines agent that I have been standing in line for 20 minutes and did not expect to miss luggage deadline. Only then she said: \"You should have checked-in at a self-service next door. Here we only do customer service\" (apparently, not a great one at that). When I looked up, there was not a single sign that said \"Customer Service\" nor was there a sign that said \"Self check-in that way\" with an arrow.Now, I am waiting for my next flight, outraged by customer disservice while I could have been at a MAGIC apparel show as originally planned.

Terminal and finally getting to 4 ON FOOT is NOT two minutes. \u00a0It is more like 12 with a hustle. \u00a0Which is what I did. \u00a0Hustle. \u00a0I'd already wasted time in line in terminal three. \u00a0So in the sun my carry on and full bag in tow I RAN to terminal four.I went straight up to the US Airways baggage attendants who took my bag, said I had 45 minutes and to relax. \u00a0He said I had PLENTY of time. \u00a0Nonetheless I ran myself to security where I waited in an excruciatingly long line. \u00a0I explained to the woman taking the IDs (as by the time I got up to her my flight was leaving in 25 minutes) that I had been sent to the wrong terminal and although everyone along the way had said I had plenty of time there was only 25 minutes left. \u00a0She said there was nothing she could do. \u00a0I asked if I can't move ahead in the line can you call the gate and let them know I am on my way? \u00a0I checked in this morning and my bag is already loaded on the plane. \u00a0She said there was no way to call the gate. \u00a0At this point I was getting the distinct feeling the attitude and lack of help was coming from an assumption that I just decided to show up late. \u00a0No. \u00a0I got to the airport on time. I checked in in the morning, arrived early and attempted to check the bag I'd already paid for an entire hour+ before my flight. \u00a0I got up closer and asked a different gentleman working security who laughed and said I had 20 minutes I was fine. \u00a0I finally got through security, ran to the area where my gate was supposed to be and nothing. \u00a044E was nowhere. \u00a0I asked someone who motioned to a set of stairs I needed to go down. \u00a0I get down and find out from someone else that I need to wait for a shuttle to take me to my gate!!!!! I have now been to one terminal, walked the length of two additional terminals, went through security, walked to the 40's and 44E required a shuttle I had to wait for to get to the actual gate. \u00a0Now the clock was really ticking so I AGAIN asked for help. \u00a0I explained to an attendant at the shuttle area how I had been misdirected and was about to catch a plane that was leaving in like 14 minutes could they please help me. \u00a0I was told I needed to wait for the shuttle and they couldn't call ahead because they close the doors 10 minutes before departure and I would not make it.As you have likely deduced by now I could not get on the flight.Eventually I was re-routed through United to a flight that gets me in to SA at 12:21 in the morning at which time I will need to locate my baggage that arrived hours before me in a different terminal and I am now missing my ride that was to pick me up at 10 and I have to take a cab..There is more but I am out of space.

Well after applying for the card and getting approved, literally while I had my flight (and my friends so I could more miles) pending on the american airlines page; the approval page does not supply me with the actual credit card #, expiration and security digits I need to complete payment and book the flight. Of course, waiting nearly 2-3 weeks for my card to arrive in the mail was not an option bc I was trying to lock in that exact flight for the cheapest I had seen it. And after speaking with several people at American Airlines, was given a sorry there's nothing we can do!! So needless to say I applied for the card for NO REASON AT ALL, it was TOTAL FALSE ADVERTISEMENT THAT YOU CAN SAVE $100 on the flight you're trying to book in that moment....and now nearly a year later I have nothing but a hassle and false promise AGAIN!!!! I was all excited to finally use that $100 credit that still exists on my account (which may I add becomes moot if not used within the first year bc the annual fee for the card itself is $95 (RIDICULOUS) which is only waived the first year)....and my friend also purchased a $75 gift card through American Airlines for me to redeem tonight and book my flight...and surprise surprise.....the card number can't be provided until after 1/28/16..... 3 DAYS FROM NOW!! Here my poor friend took time to speak with a representative, pay an extra $25 to hold the seats next to her and reserve the flight for me at the cheapest price she's seen, and an extra $75 to send me a gift card to apply to the flight/convince me to go and book tonight......and I can't book it and use the credit until that fucking GC number comes through!!! I spoke to two people over 30 minutes and no one can help. My only option is to wait until tomorrow, as they can only hold my reservation at that price for 24 hours....and hope that the GC comes through. Because if I were just to book it now on my CC, I can't use the GC to apply to my credit card bill, but can only redeem at time of booking.

I booked a return cheap flight that was advertised as \"No Cancelation Fee\", giving the allusion one could somehow make use of the ticket if it was in fact canceled. Once I cancelled the ticket I was informed that there would be a $200. change of ticket fee. My ticket was only $168. so the ticket had no value. I think this was intentionally misleading advertisement and a practice that should be discontinued. I happened to book the outgoing flight with JetBlue and they charged $100 (HALF the price) for the exact same kind of ticket. So please tell me what is so different about your airline that gives it the merit of charging twice as much for a change of ticket than on a smaller airline, other than because you can.

My purpose for this passage spawns from my current rage as I sit in my beautiful Maui destination, suitcaseless. As you step into the AA terminal in LAX you immediately notice the unmistakeable red jackets worn by the \"employees\". My first gripe was the whole self-checkin system. One would wait in line to check in his or her bag for approximately 20 minutes to discover what they were waiting for was a cluster of broken machines and an old couple who spends too much time trying to figure out how to work the machines. If that's not worse enough, the attendants who should be ATTENDING are not ATTENDING to the freaking customers. Their expressions are depressing. Their attitudes are equivalent. Waiting in line, one employee said in my family's direction that we were to wait in a certain area to get checked in the TSA. Following her directions, we promptly moved into the area in which the lady implied. Little had we known that she was not referring to us, and we received a snotty laughter as she seemed certain that she wasn't talking to us. Sure enough I volunteered to load my suitcase at the gate and the lousy folks lost my bag. Screw you American Airlines!

Here is the complaint I sent them via a survey they asked me to fill out.I was very disappointed that first of all, an American Airlines flight was half an hour late to its hub DCA--without any explanation. Upon the flight between DCA and STL and after the delay, we were never once offered any type of onboard snack which added to the initial annoyance from being late. As I had not eaten dinner, I was looking forward to receiving a snack and starved during the first leg of the flight. On the leg between DCA and STL, since it was too early to order any type of food/meal, I waited to order food for the next leg from STL to LAX. As we were delayed at STL for about an hour because of a thunder/lightning storm, we took off late and when the flight attendants came around with food and snacks, I asked if I could order something to eat and the flight attendant simply said that it was too late to order any food when I clearly saw sandwiches in the kitchen as I boarded the flight. Had we not been delayed, I would have still had time to order food. I don't think it's fair that just because it's past a certain time you should stop serving food especially when the STL-LAX leg was about 3 hours long. Especially after a delay, when we would've had been eligible for food service were we able to leave on time. Also, I read your inflight menu over and over and nowhere did it say that food would not be served after a certain time. I asked for a few more granola bars, which is all they offered and the flight attendant only gave me 1 additional bar even when I clearly stated that I wanted more than that since I had not eaten at all since about lunchtime EST and now it was 9pm CST. Without food, I became very lightheaded and queasy during the flight. I felt like I wanted to vomit when I never get sick during air travel and I am a frequent traveler. When I wanted to throw away a soda can while passing by the lavatory, I attempted to hand it to a flight attendant who was sitting and reading a magazine, she rudely said, \"Trash can is right there.\" without pointing and I had to find it and throw away my trash in the dark. Bottom line, especially when your airline experiences delays--it's very important to take extra care of your customers. I believe a lot of people traveling from DCA to LAX were especially peeved that we did not have adequate snack and food service for the extended length of our flight. We were delayed twice and never once received any extra care from the staff. Instead, I was continually treated like I didn't matter. My previous experiences with American have never been bad but this last experience has made me decide that I will never fly American Airlines again. Before this experience, I even considered making American my primary airline and applying for your credit card. However, now I'll be sticking to other airlines who care about their customers. I will likely be applying for a Delta American Express card in the near future.

Checkout time at the hotel was 12PM, since our flight did not leave until 9PM we had to pay for late check out or we would have to be on our own for full day with nowhere to shower, etc... before our 8.5 hour flight back to the mainland... I had signed up for text notification about the flight when we checked into the hotel. \u00a0At 2PM I received a text stating that the flight had been cancelled... I immediately called the airline and was told that there were no other flights available for that day and we would be again delayed until 4:30PM the next day... I asked what the reason was for the cancellation and the agent provided no information, she said she didn't know and that was the earliest flight we could get out on. \u00a0After our experience the night before and the information our travel agent gave us I knew this was not true. \u00a0I told her this was not an option, I had to leave that day as I was already taking 1 unpaid day from work. \u00a0She finally offered to book us on a Delta flight for 4:10PM. \u00a0As I was on the phone with her my husband was repacking our luggage so we immediately ran downstairs and grabbed a taxi (at our expense) to rush to the airport. \u00a0We arrived in just enough time to check into the flight, however, Delta showed us on the flight in the computer but AA had not transferred the ticket to them. \u00a0We had to then go down to AA desk to have that piece completed. \u00a0We made it just in time for the Delta flight. \u00a0This is the worst experience I have ever experienced with an airline. \u00a0And absolutely no explanation from the airline at all except for obvious untruths (was the initial cancellation due to them waiting for a part? because the flight came in late from Dallas? or was it because a bird flew into the engine???). \u00a0I can't believe that a major airline can operate this way with no repercussions."}, {"count": 4764, "date": "11/7/2011", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "I now recall why I have many hundreds of thousands of miles with Delta and United and several thousand on American.

I am an average size male and couldn't move. No leg room so if you wanted to use the lavatory you would have to wake up the people next to you. The TV monitors which they showed movies were like 10 inch monitors that you couldn't see. They charge for checking in bags and it doesn't look like they monitor carry on's because some many people brought these carry on's that didn't fit in the overheads.
