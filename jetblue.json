I got to JFK around 1, had some lunch then made my way over to my gate around 2. At about 3pm, I got a notification from the Jet Blue app that my flight was delayed and wouldn't be leaving until 6pm. A minute or two later, I got another notification that the flight was delayed until 6:33 pm and my gate had changed. Soon after an announcement was made on the loudspeaker to let everyone know of the change, and I begrudgingly made my way to my new gate. At around 4pm, the flight was delayed again and wouldn't be departing until 7:33pm. I found this out again from the app notification. An announcement wasn't made until about 45 minutes after I received the notification. So some passengers had no idea. Apparently our original plane needed maintenance, so the new plane was coming from Havana, Cuba and would need to be cleaned and swept by Customs before we could board. One of the pilots was also running late.Boarding started at 6:45. Another flight in the gate next to us was boarding at the same time we were. Announcements for this other flight had been made many, many times stating the flight was pretty full and asking for volunteers to check their bags (for free) because there wouldn't be enough overhead space. On my flight TO New York, they also told us it was full and asked for volunteers several times long before boarding even began. NO announcement like this was made for my flight out of NY. When I got on the plane at 6:56, the stewardess told the woman behind me there was only room for one more bag and she would have to check hers. I was so excited I didn't have to check mine because I didn't want any additional waiting time once I landed. However, when walking to my seat, I could see only 3 or 4 overhead bins were open (the rest were closed) and there was no room at all for a rolling carryon. I ended up having to check my bag after all which just made things worse.So by the time I'm seated, it's 7 pm. Soon after we get an announcement from the pilot that there was a water spill in the galley and a technician was on board working on cleaning it up. A little bit later, we leave finally leave the gate and start driving around the tarmac. I'm doing sudoku puzzles and have my headphones in trying to forget about the 3+ extra hours I just spent in the airport when I realize we are still on the tarmac. We don't get airborne until after 8 pm!!! We arrive at the Buffalo airport around 9 pm and make our way to baggage claim. I thought my bag would be first on the carousel since it was loaded towards the very end, but of course my bag is one of the last. By the time I get in the car, it's 9:20 pm and I've spent approx. 9 hours in airports/in the air and I'm home almost 4 hours later than scheduled.Jet Blue sent an email during the flight notifying us that we would be receiving a credit soon for the inconvenience. I received a $75 credit to use toward my next Jet Blue flight within one year from the date issued. Unfortunately, I didn't plan on flying Jet Blue anytime in the next year, and after all that, I really don't want to chance a repeat experience, so all I'm really left with is a bad memory of the airline.Giving it 3 stars because I've flown before without an issue, my flight into NY was fine, and they issued the credits quickly. But there's still a bad taste in my mouth."}, {"date": "9/12/2019", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Absolutely terrible service. Flight was delayed in SFO so moved to OAK. STILL got delayed over two hours after boarding, then arrived in NY an hour after connecting flight had boarded and was forced to wait another 4 hours for the next connecting flight.After all this, their answer about compensation was that because the initial delay was flight maintenance, they can't compensate for our loss. NEWSFLASH: maintenance is the fault of the company. Try having higher quality planes and higher quality routine service so they don't require service during operation? Oh wait, that would require competence, which the management and ownership groups clearly have none of.

And then she apologized for leaving me on hold for five minutes.This rep went above and beyond for me. Her thoughtful and generous gesture was unexpected and greatly appreciated.

They wanted to apply the same principle as Southwest by offering low cost travel. They set themselves apart by offering amenities such as in-TV at every seat, flight entertainment, and Sirius XM satellite radio. JetBlue Airway fleets consist of five aircrafts. The Airbus A220-300, Airbus A320-200, Airbus A321-200, Airbus A322neo, and the Embraer 190. I love that JetBlue provides leather seats and the most legroom amongst U.S. domestic carriers. I was able to stretch my short legs out without any issues. They offer free in flight entertainment, but you'll have to purchase their earphones if you're an iPhone user. You'll also have access to free gate to gate WiFi, DirecTV, Sirius XM Radio, complimentary snacks, non-alcoholic drinks, and Dunkin' Donuts coffee. You can also purchase a blanket or JetBlue snack box. I'm not sure why airlines have done away with blankets and pillows. The whole point of flying is to be comfortable. If you want more legroom you can upgrade to the EvenMore Space seat. JetBlue flies to 102 destinations in North, Central, and South America. The destinations include Aruba, The Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Grenada, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Saint Maarten, Saint Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos, and the United States.If you're an avid traveler you should invest in the TrueBlue frequent flyer program.

We were supposed to depart at 1:59, and we received no less than 6 emails indicating a changing departure time. The only explanation given was that the pilots were nearing their expiration time, so they left, but the incoming pilots are delayed, so now they are waiting for the initial pilots to come back. My question is, why was this not communicated earlier? JFK is not a large airport- where could these pilots be! My opinion is they did not want to take the flight so they are delaying themselves getting back so their expiration time will coincide . So you may be asking yourself, what have they done to compensate for this OVER TWO HOUR DELAY? Oh.

This airline is as bad as some third world country airline in the middle of no where where you don't know if you will fly the day you purchased your ticket at all. Since end of May I flew 3 times between Tampa and JFK. Only one of 6 flights were on time. the rest was a combination between cancelled flight or delay from 5 hours till 11 hours. None of the instances were truly to the weather, rather the incoherent chaos this company became. Here is the beef: - none of the times flights were severely delayed, would you see any early update on delay. Each time I cleared TSA before I found out I was stuck.- When flight was cancelled - they provided no option - I could not get through their website, or via phone. When I informed the manager that I have very severe situation where I must be in Tampa next morning because my mother has scheduled operation, I was directed at the back of a line that took 3 hours before I spoke to a rep, who booked me on another connection and when I cleared the TSA again, I found out that this flight was also delay beyond me making connection to Tampa. On that last trip on the way back, everything started all over again, with severe delay that was updated less than an hour before boarding. When I demanded to speak to manager and demanded that they provide us (clients) with an option, I again was met with \"there is nothing they can do \" at that point I expressed that I feel like I'm being treated as cattle with no regard for my time and that Jet Blue became a third world country airline when you never know when and if you will flight out.

I turned 100s of people away from them over all those years and they will never get my business. Unless Jetblue owns up and apologizes, they are next!!! ...and you my dear reader, remember that we still do have a power to show those corporations who thing that we no longer matter, that we do and let them know that with your pocketbooks.For JetBlue - you got a choice.

When we come to airport, lady in check in line said that plane is fool and they can't seat us together, the only option left are MORE SPACE SEATS that cost$50 or $55. when we boarded plane was half empty. I was so pissed we didn't buy it and seat separate. I think it's their strategy. They put families in different seats with hope that people will pay for MORE SPACE SEATS to be together.

You'll need to do better than call. We had to stop and buy a bathing suit, couple changes of clothes, summer foot wear, personal care things etc. Many phone calls and we find out it went to Bosco Bay or similar in CA. It will be in Boston in 2 days when my son arrives. Oh good. My sons stuff was packed in there too as he was coming right from a job. NOT! 3 hours of searching for it and nada. It supposedly went to MEXICO and came back to Boston via United and was in United's baggage claim. Nope. So, now my son has no clothing except what's on his back. Another stop to buy stuff for him to wear. More phone calls. Lots of BS and run around by the people on the phone. Finally, 6 DAYS LATER we get a call \"Come get your bag we have it\". WHAT!!! No way you get it to us. Ok, now we are in the hands of a delivery company that has a 1 star rating and does not care AT ALL about their service. They say they will delivery the bag between...3 am and \u00a07 am on a Sunday. WHAT!!! Never have I heard of anything like that. We are on an island so we had to sit in a car in the parking lot waiting for the bag to be delivered. It did not come. They ended up getting a tracking number and found out the bag never even left Boston until after 9 am. It finally arrived at 1 pm! The delivery phone person was the rudest, non professional person we have ever dealt with. The suitcase was intact is the only good message of this saga. Moral of the story. Jet Blue looses baggage often and on direct flights. Jet Blue does not find the lost luggage quickly and does not keep track of it once found. Jet Blue does not hire reliable delivery companies to return the luggage that you paid for and they lost. As far as the flight was concerned. It was an over nighter and they had no complaints.

Almost everyone was settled in their seats when we were directed to deplane bc there was no pilot!

At that time we were informed that we all (a full flight) needed to go to customer service to be re-booked. Customer service was understaffed (2 people for a line of about 100), so I called the 1-800 # while in line and was able to get my family booked on the next flight. However, while in line, we were informed that there would be no hotel or food vouchers given for the inconvenience, so my family (including a newborn) \"slept\" at JFK that night.

Since discovering them in the early 2000s, it has been the go-to airline for me and my family.I'm not sure what initially attracted us to JetBlue - but it was enough that it made us travel to JFK whenever we had to travel by air (at the time JetBlue was only flying out of JFK). Over time, though, the company has grown and we were happy to learn they expanded service to LGA and HPN. For a low-cost carrier, JetBlue has a number of amenities that makes it stand out. First off, the fact that every seat has its own TV screen served with DirecTV is a huge feature. It really helps pass the time, and because there's multiple channels theres a better chance there's something for everyone. You can also view the map and travel route on the screen to see how far along you are on your trip, plus thye offer movies at an additional cost. While I like this feature, some of them are in need of an upgrade - the last few times I've flown I've been stuck with a wonky screen or a headphone jack that doesn't work properly (womp womp). Hot tip: bring your own headphones, they charge you for theirs. JetBlue has no first/business/economy class, we're all equal - however in its place JetBlue offers rows of seats with additional leg room, called Even More Space. I'm satisfied with the leg room in a regular row, but my parents thing for the additional cost its worth it - it depends on your preference. They give out free snacks - usually something small like chips, crackers, or cookies, plus a beverage. They offer meal boxes for an additional price, though for short flights you won't need it. Flying is a hassle, and I'll admit I've had both good and bad experiences with JetBlue - but the good definitely outweighs the bad.

Bad traffic luck took me 2 hours to get 10miles to the airport from Brooklyn because: #NYC (medical emergency on the subway, bumper-to-bumper traffic once I switched to a rideshare). It was looking like i'm would arrive at the airport at... 4:57pm. Departure time.#1 Called JetBlue before arriving to ask how I should handle the situation. Representative says \"Just keep on keepin' on. I could switch your flight but from my system, I'd have to charge you. If you're that close, they should help you out free of charge.\" +1 point for training well, even when an upsell is available.#2 JetBlue rep at security hears my plight, and immediately starts making calls to see if he can push me through security and get me to my gate. Sadly, we were both a moment too late but his motivation alone was encouraging. +1 point for immediate effort to help, regardless of whether my story was true or a total fabrication.#3 JetBlue rep at the kiosks all jump into action, take advantage of available priority seating, and move things around to let me fly into a different, nearby airport the same day instead of having to wait another 24hrs for the next flight to my destination. +1 point. This done while someone was being trained, and a third made jokes and redirected others in line behind me to make sure nobody was held up too much. +3 points.#4 Because they had to get fancy with reassigning my flight, the rep at the gate had to help me with a seat. After a short chat and sympathy with the fiasco I experienced to get to the airport, and an adorable exchange with his coworker, they assigned me to a seat with extra leg room to make the experience more positive. +2 points.I should mention, I was partially motivated to offer this level of detail because on my recent trip with the airline-that-shall-not-be-named, very similar circumstances arose and they got pretty much every single one of these points miserably wrong (when I wasn't actually late, but their mess of a kiosk line put me past their requisite minimum check-in time).

You would think that once the plane has left Orlando (2.5 hour flight to JFK), JB will be able to inform the waiting passengers on the rest of the plan pretty accurately. But no!

They continued to mislead us thereby prevented us from making other travel arrangements.Then, at 10pm, with ~180 passengers learning that the flight is suddenly cancelled, JB assigned two clueless gate agents to deal with the mess.

With the exception of a horrible customer service experience on the phone the night before, things were pretty up. Flash forward six days later--Sunday, May 27. We returned from San Francisco to JFK in the evening. Due to cloudy weather--which is no one's fault--our plane got in a bit late, and due to congestion on the runway, we got off the plane late, as well.

Therefore, we were very upset to see that one of our suitcases was damaged when we got home. What's even more repulsive and disgusting is that JetBlue makes it difficult for you to make a report, or as they like to call it \"voice a concern\" unless you're still physically at the airport--within 4 hours. Nonetheless, I did sone digging, and voiced my concern online, and received a confirmation email that I would hear back from the airline within 48 hours. It's been over 72 hours--and I have not heard anything back.

For \u00a0health reasons \u00a0I \u00a0can not go through the scanner and the disregard for another human is mind boggling. How do these people get jobs there ? There are witnesses during the evening shift who saw what she was doing. She would \u00a0not give me \u00a0her name and wouldn't call a manager. All I asked for was to pat me down. Did I commit a crime?!? Who employs these awful people who \u00a0 I can't even call a human?? Because \u00a0if she was Hunan she would have at least 1 oz of compassion!!! This woman worked a shift between 6:30 and 7:30 pm in the JFK jet blue terminal, so if anyone at all cares to make this right, please look at the cameras and see \u00a0what she did to me! She made a spectacle of me! I hope justice is served and this woman loses her job! She should not have a job that involves working with people, because she doesn't know how to deal with humans!

JetBlue reached out and worked to help rectify the situation. Considering the extra flights I had to purchase to catch up with my previous itinerary, I'm very grateful for their help.I'll be flying with them again for sure. ORIGINAL:Normally, JetBlue is my airline of choice. But that was without experiencing them at their worst which I was able to do yesterday and today. (Aren't I lucky?)I had an 11:19AM flight out of JAX that was delayed for over 12 hours. During that time we deplaned twice. We didn't arrive in JFK until after midnight. The first delay was weather related. The second was due to the delay in removing the jet bridge. We lost our window to depart. The third time was due to paperwork having to be FAXED (yes, faxed) to report a broken tray table. It caused me to miss an internal flight with one of JetBlue's partners, TAP Portugal. (Did I mention I had a ten-hour layover for the original trip? More than enough time for a couple delays...at least that's what I thought originally.)At first, the JetBlue staff seemed helpful. But when I expressed that I needed to be at my final destination by a certain time, they ceased to care. I'm about to lose thousands on missed reservations and more. And I'm not rich. I've worked very hard and saved to afford this vacation. JetBlue, you could have better staffed JFK. The Memorial Holiday weekend is a notorious heavy travel period. You could have recognized inclement weather and made contingency plans. You could have communicated better. You could have waited to file the damn paperwork on a tray table. You could have offered vouchers for flights or hotels. You could have accepted responsibility in severely altering my itinerary and helped. Your partnership with TAP seems like little more than a joke if you have to call the same customer service I have too. There are so many things you could have done. You have a partnership with Lufthansa and they had a flight I could have used...but no one could be creative enough to get me on it!? Apparently you're a great airline when times are easy and skies are blue (hence the name?).

I'm there.Here's the thing......... I was very pleasantly surprised to see how comfortable, efficient, clean, and fast this plane flew. \u00a0Going to NYC, we got there in 4 hours and change........ don't think I've ever flown there for that little amount.... but then, we usually leave out of LAX. \u00a0Mental note to self......... LEAVE FROM BURBANK ALWAYS if at all possible. \u00a0Flight attendants were really nice. \u00a0 Let's face it, for most of us, we are sandwiched in like sardines on every flight of every airline, but I didn't feel that way on this airline. \u00a0It was pretty painless, I have to say.Two more really cool things...... JetBlue does NOT charge for baggage. \u00a0Let me repeat........ they do NOT charge for checked baggage (1 bag per person), and you don't need to be any VIP or have a trillion miles to get free baggage. \u00a0That was super awesome. \u00a0I saved myself $100..... $25 per bag for me and my husband, round trip. \u00a0I'm VERY happy about that. \u00a0The second cool thing was that they randomly select \u00a0people to go through their TSA security check with a minimal of fuss, and I was one of them selected....... I didn't have to remove my shoes, empty my bag or anything. \u00a0I could keep my coat on and just set my purse, etc on the conveyor belt. \u00a0AWESOME. \u00a0This happened at both Burbank and JFK. \u00a0All the way around, this airline experience was with a minimal of fuss and bother....... which is rare to say that when it comes to air travel."}, {"date": "7/21/2017", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "review": "Asked agent what blue boarding group meant His response was coach .

Out of all the airlines ( especially for those of you flying in and out of the Caribe; Caribbean for the Gringos ;o) this is the airline to go to. If you are flying in and out of JFK this is it. It's the newest terminal, with the best eating options in the airport ( and working conditions, but I'm sure you don't care about that). JetBlue is pretty cheap, it is rising as a major airline and the tickets show, although it's still not as expensive as Delta. Anyway, the terminal itself is pretty snazzy compared to those of JFK. Eating options have a decent size food court consisting of DD, Cheeseburger, Italian, Hot food buffet, Phillycheese steaks and Italian foods( mainly pizza). There is of course Starbucks, Baked by Melissa, More Italians joints, Mexican, Ben and Jerry's and my personal favorite Jamba Juice. JetBlue is clean. Spacious modern and it has lots of seating in the center of the terminal. There is an outdoor deck in departure for you smokers which gives a cool view of the great outdoors of the airport...and a doggy popping area which is super thoughtful. I really don't travel a lot believe it or not but for you jet setters who travel internationally I recommend one thing.Global Entry.Hate long immigration lines, TSA ( Security Checks) and quick connections? Than quit being cheap and pay 100.00 USD for 5 years and get Global Entry. It will make your life easier, follow Customs and TSA \u00a0regulations and everything will okay. Jet through Immigration, TSA Pre-Check and obey Customs law. It's really not that hard but guess that just depends on international travel experience. This is of course NYC, of course there will be lines for everything, so be patient, make times in between connections and remember your cause is not sole. Millions of residents and even more tourist come in and out of this city..Overall? If I have the option, than definitely fly out of JetBlue if JFK is your home port. No question about it. There is a mutlifloor parking garage nearby if you leave your car overnight but it's better to park at Leffrets for long term. Otherwise take the Airtrain to and from the city.Seriously this airport is simple if you can read. And people complain about staff but this terminal and airport is one of the most busiest in world, and New Yorkers have no patience for wasted time.Welcome to JetBlue.Welcome to New York City.

It is definitely my first go-to option and I'm happy that they are always expanding their reach to various places within the US as well as globally. They are reliable, hardly ever over-book their flights and accessible.PROS:Customer service: absolutely superb. Every flight attendant has been not only friendly but personable. \u00a0When flying to PDX last year we had to emergently land the plane due to a serious medical issue on board in Buffalo, NY. We were only there an hour and they gave every passenger a $50 credit for being such troopers. Plus, they gave us free access to all the in-flight movies. They didn't have to do that - very generous. TV's: Let's be real. On long flights, those are a god send. I can get my fix of Food Network while Ina Garten lulls me to sleep. They have a decent variety of channels not to mention Sirius XM radio. And they are especially a lifesaver if you're travelling alone and you're sitting next to a chatty cathy. (We have all been there.)The snacks: Truth be told, I've been on a lot of flights and once (for example) when I was flying Delta - all they gave us was a glass of water. Albeit it wasn't a long flight, but still. Whereas JetBlue gives out an assortment including chocolate chip cookies, those blue chips and quite a few more. If you're buddy-buddy with the attendants, they will give you two.*The legroom: Just the right amount. Yeah, I can't do my yoga routine but I can stretch till my heart's content.The T5 Terminal: Fantastic renovations that make the entire JetBlue experience even that much better. The food and store options are very impressive.CONS: Baggage: Disappointed about that one. They used to have a 1 free checked bag policy which they were IMO well-known for... and got rid of that recently. That was a huge plus. Now it's $25, what a bummer. Prices: Most of the time they are reasonable, but lately I have seen quite an inconsistency with prices. I suppose that may be an overall issue with flights in general.Overall, I love JetBlue. They have an excellent rapport with their customers and in the past few flights my attendants have all been hilarious and entertaining.** If they went to Europe and beyond, that would be phenomenal. Here's to future travel!__________________________________________*Okay, okay. They'll give you two anyway if you just ask. But sometimes I like to feel special.**I don't even know if this is allowed, BUT. Our flight attendant to NOLA last month said if we answer trivia questions based on JetBlue or pop culture - we would get FREE BOOZE.

When she got up, seemingly to try to clean it up, we notified a flight attendant. The initial flight attendant was rude and unhelpful. He had also been rude and completely unhelpful during the boarding pass, not allowing us to put one of our carry-ons in an obviously open section of the overhead compartment, saying that it was full when it visually was not (ultimately after waiting and pushing back, he allowed us to put it there, proving it had been open all along). When we were obviously upset that there was a cat who had diarrhea in the seat in front of us as we geared up for a 6hr flight and looking for a solution, the flight attendant and the lead flight crew manager with both increadibly rude and unhelpful, misogynistic in their tone, treating us as if this was a completely unreasonable thing to be upset about. We suffered through the entire flight, with everyone around us, trying to block our noses and mouths, breathing in perfume or tiger balm that we had with us.

This was around 10am on a Sunday, with small crowds at JFK. Upon asking the ladies standing around the security check line where to check our bags, we were directed to the kiosks. But when we tried to ask details, like who would take our bags once we got the tags, they just kept repeating, \"use the kiosk to get your passes and tags for your bags!\" With little help available, we figured it would be safer to get assistance at the bag check-in counter, whose line appeared to be shorter than 20-30 min. But this line ended up being an hour and a half. Many were becoming very upset at the slow moving line, with one woman so irate the ticket agents came close to calling security on her. All this despite having 5-6 windows open and 7-8 agents available, as customers appeared to be spending 10-30 minutes at a window, with no one ever coming to explain the delay. Fortunately, we arrived at the airport in time to make it to the gate a few minutes before our flight departed.

However, I had a very unfortunate encounter with a TSA official by the name of Marcos. He was completely adamant that my carry on luggage did not meet the carryon luggage sizes or dimensions for JetBlue. I found extremely hard to believe as I have traveled with this luggage as a carry on COUNTLESS amount of times. I explained to Marcos that this carry-on luggage contained my wedding dress in it and if closets or such were offered like at most airlines and he stated no. He also suggested that a I take out my wedding dress and just carry it. I mean, how ridiculous is that, if it's perfectly packed?! As a traveling bride, many scenarios run through your head when you have no control as to what will happen to your wedding dress. JetBlue has ALWAYS had superb customer service so I can not fault them for that. However, JetBlue should consider retraining some employees on empathy measures as well as maybe revisiting there policies when it comes to brides, the airline offers no closets.

In fact, just in the last 3 months, two of my flights have been cancelled after waiting at the airport for hours. This most recent cancellation (due to weather) was somewhat out of their hands- but the way JetBlue handled the situation was disappointing. We sat in the terminal for 4 hours, boarded the flight, sat on the runway for 2 hours, only to be deboarded at midnight. Our pilot/crew notified JetBlue early enough to have gotten a replacement crew (the original crew timed out after all the weather delays). But no replacement crew. This most recent time, there were long lines of cranky passengers, all hoping to get onto another flight (most folks couldn't get onto something until at least 2 days later- shocking given the frequency of the NYC-Bay Area route). And worst of all, the JetBlue support staff was not equipped to handle the understandably cranky crowd- the staff was confused (some didn't even know the flight had been cancelled), impatient and not helpful.

Based on my experiences of 6/22/2017 and 6/24/2017 I will NEVER purchase another fare from JetBlue and I will NEVER recommend them to anyone. In the spring I began making plans to attend my daughters graduation from grad school in Vermont. Using Expedia, I searched for a reasonable fare and decided on JetBlue. The fares I purchased included a flight from Ohare to JFK with a short layover at JFK and then a flight to Vermont. The same package in reverse was available for us three days later when we wanted to return home. So in all I purchased three fares, one for myself, my husband and youngest daughter and altogether, we were scheduled for two flights to get to Vermont and two flights to return to Chicago. On the drive into Ohare on the morning of 6/22/2017 \u00a0I received a text message that the flight to JFK and then the connecting flight to Vermont had been cancelled. There was no reasonable explanation given. \u00a0Nothing. Just a lousy text message letting me know that my hopes of getting to Vermont to see my daughter receive recognition for academic honors that evening and then to watch her graduate from graduate school the next day was cancelled in a brief, cold text message that started with \"CANCELLED\". I called Expedia who helped me arrange for another flight to Burlington but they also told me to keep the flight with JetBlue for my return flight as they hadn't cancelled those two flights. Bad idea. I should of cancelled it and made changes right then but I thought this kind of event was something unusual. \u00a0On Saturday 6/24/2017 when we went to the airport in Vermont to depart, the JetBlue flight was delayed for around four hours. JetBlue arranged for us to get a later connecting flight to Chicago that was suppose to leave around 6:00. When we got to JFK, the flight to Chicago was on the board and it said \"on time\". I think we may have been there an hour or so and suddenly the status of the flight was changed to \"CANCELLED\". Again, we got no answers or no help from JetBlue's customer service with the exception of telling us where we could pick up our checked bag in the airport and rescheduling a plane the next day that \u00a0we later learned would supposedly leave some time around 2:00 in afternoon and get us home by 9:30 after two connecting flights. Fearing we would be stranded in yet another city we made other arrangements. Essentially, we were left stranded at JFK by JetBlue. \u00a0There were no available hotel rooms this weekend as it was Pride weekend in New York City. \u00a0 We searched for rooms, Expedia searched for us and we used the services at JFK and learned there was nothing available. We were given no help or direction from JetBlue that was meaningful or helpful in our situation as we had never been to New York and only expected our stay to be a brief one as a connecting flight. \u00a0So to be clear, three out of the four flights we had arranged months in advance were cancelled by JetBlue with just the flick of a text message. I will NEVER fly JetBlue ever again. I am utterly appalled for what passed as service and the willingness to leave people stranded with no assistance. There are few words to describe the service we received from JetBlue over this weekend but it was punctuated with an attitude of \"couldn't care less\" and your on your own.

My outgoing flight did not seem as easy as I expected but I figured it was just a fluke. The check-in process for the flight leaving out of JFK was less than pleasant as well. I checked in online nearly a full day before my flight and received a message to see the JetBlue counter for a seat assignment because there were no more seats available unless I chose to \"upgrade\". When I arrived at the airport (nearly 2 hours ahead of my flight), I stood on line to check my bag only to be (rudely) turned away to check my bag in myself at the kiosk-a different line. I did so, tagged my own bag at the kiosk and returned again to the line to get to the counter to drop my bag. I asked about my seat assignment at the counter and was told they didn't assign seats there. At this point, I'm still not even sure if I have a seat on the flight, since many airlines overbook. I arrive to the gate (about an hour early) and ask about the seat. Melissa at the counter was \"even more\" rude. When I inquired about a seat and requested a window, she told me that there were no more seats available to choose from, unless I chose to pay for an \"even more space seat for an additional fee\". This was obviously a lie and a scam they were using to squeeze every possible dollar out of me and others. I could see the stack of tickets in her hand of other passengers without seat assignments like myself. She was not trying to accommodate me, the customer. She was either too lazy to switch my seat or was told not to by her employer in hopes that I would pay for a seat. Oh, and guess what? The seat I was assigned wound up being in the \"even more leg room\" category. Glad I didn't opt to pay for the seat I was sitting in, because I was given it for free. The flight to my destination was cramped and uncomfortable, and I am not overweight. The \"free\" WiFi was not easily accessible and the tv in my seat was not working. We were delayed 40 minutes for \"routine maintenance checks\" on the return flight. Sure. If it was a routine thing, it shouldn't be delaying my flight. Yes, I want the plane I'm on to be safe, but I don't like being lied to. What's happened to the airline I've raved about to so many people? Did JetBlue get bought out recently by some other airline? Did they cut pay or stop offering paid vacation to their employees to make them so unpleasant? Where did my favorite airline go?

I used it when it first came out back in the 90s then I switched to Delta and then back and forth between the two and now use JetBlue more than Delta. JetBlue card gives us 50% off from any inflight purchases. That's something to take advantage of if you need anything.

It was the worst travel experience I have ever encountered. To make matters worse, many of their reps will not be honest and state that the delays are due to construction at JFK, which grants only one arrival ramp. They are operating \"business as usual\" knowing that this will produce extreme delays and then blaming said delays on weather. However, only JetBlue was affected. My return flight (on the perfect day) was also delayed. This airline is terrible and does not care about customer satisfaction. Below is the message that I sent to a JetBlue representative. They gave me an additional credit for $50 (on a flight that was $616, booked almost a month in advance), which forces me to give them my business again or else I get nothing for what I had to endure. They wouldn't tell me who I should contact to ask for a refund and of course the website is unclear. My flight was 424 on March 31st. Here's my email:\"I wish to obtain a phone number so that I can call to make a complaint about my flight and receive a refund. A $50 credit is insulting compared to what I endured that day. While delays are an unfortunate reality of air travel, there was a serious mishandling of affairs on the part of many of the staff regarding my flight which caused further delays and, quite honestly, the worst travel experience I have yet to encounter.Since customers are assumed to have a smart phone and/or constant Internet access, I did not receive any notifications of delays or changes until I reached the airport. The delay was said to be roughly 3 hours due to weather and limited ramp access at JFK, however, this does not explain why flight 524 (originally scheduled to leave a couple of hours after my flight) left before us. None of the staff could explain why this was happening, and one staff member admitted in an announcement that our plane had been mysteriously removed from our gate and had to be retrieved again.Due to this, I missed my connecting flight - which again, is something that I'm aware can happen but what followed was simply appalling. I was informed, after asking 2 people, that I had missed my 2nd flight upon arrival. The attendants that relayed this news seemed annoyed at my politely asking for information. I asked where I should go to be told when the next flight to Syracuse was and they told me to locate a \"Just Ask\" help desk. However, at 3:30am there was no-one manning these stations and I walked to all of them. These stations, mind you, should be manned at all times.I then proceeded to ask representatives at different gates for help. The first kept trying to get me to wait for someone to eventually appear at the Just Ask station. The second, when I asked what I should do and asked where my luggage would be sent, told me that I had to go to baggage claim and that my luggage would likely be sent there even though it was tagged to go to Syracuse. So I followed these instructions and my luggage was not there. I broke down and had a mild panic attack, as I had been awake for over 24hrs and hadn't eaten in over 12. I poured every last cent outside of $1.14 into this trip to see my nephew's birth and had gone through the food I'd brought in the 6 hours I was forced to wait at LAX. I finally went to departure again at JFK and was met by the one person who seemed to know what they were doing and helped me with a food voucher and helped me get on Standby for a flight several hours later at JFK. Her name was Maureen. Still, because of the mis-information I was given before being helped by Maureen, I had to go through security clearance all over again.I arrived to my destination 12hrs after I was supposed to and the experience was literally traumatic. I also missed my nephew's birth and the family greeting. A delay is understandable, but this experience was like a spit in the face considering how the staff poorly assisted and misdirected me and a credit is not just. I want a refund and I want to know who to speak to regarding this.Please advise.\"Again, I got responses from two people who refused to give me the contact information I asked for or a refund for the first flight.

The 2 points per dollar for dining grocery was a big change and I have definitely been taking advantage of it. I was pleased to see that they round up so if I spend $19.48 at whole foods when they double the points they give you 40. I recently discovered that JetBlue no longer sells gift cards. They are honoring gift cards you may already have but no longer selling/issuing new ones. I am sure this is the result of some corporate analytic research or something but not sure what. Most of the points I presently have I have accumulated from shopping not from flying. I came close to Mosaic status in 2015-16 and twice have gotten the long haul bonus but as I said I actually don't fly that much compared to some. I have over all this time and many JB flights have had pretty good luck in 17 years I have only been severely delayed twice, had one cancelled flight and once my bags did not make it to San Diego but ended up in Burbank and I did not get them back in what I would consider to be a timely manner. (I complained to customer service and they issued me a $60 credit) I will say that if you are a frequent traveler and your flight gets cancelled you are kind of screwed as JB does not have hourly flights to some destinations (such as west coast) as you see with American, Delta, United. That being said I would still opt in most cases for JetBlue. They have sales several times a year so it helps to follow them on twitter and get the emails.I am hoping to at one point in time try they Mint level service ticket where you get your own lil space in their version of first class and ice cream and such.

I was flying from JFK - New York City to Buffalo Niagara International Airport. Upon my arrival to Buffalo, I learned to discover that my baggage had been ran over and destroyed by an airport truck when flying jetBlue. Nearly everything inside was broken, damaged, and a few items were actually missing. It was incredibly disappointing in that most of these items were gifts (I rarely check bags in that I travel to Buffalo 3-4 times a year and do not have the need to). However, with Christmas, I needed to check a bag in that it contained a heavy amount of gifts and a few personal items for my stay. After speaking with the very friendly and helpful JetBlue representatives at the airport, they guided me to file the claim as they agreed that mostly everything was damaged or broken, and that it would contain a very high valued claimed amount. Luckily, since these items were mostly gifts, I had receipts for the items bought online and in-stores, particularly around Black Friday and within the past month, that were contained in the luggage. These items were of course brand new, as they were going to be given as Christmas presents. I called the baggage claim services and proceeded to start the process.I was very unimpressed that I did not have time to comprehend the situation or ask questions on the phone with my representative. I understand how insurance claims work, but I was not happy being told that over the phone and being spoken to like a child, as well as being told I needed receipts for everything (as if I was expecting for my bag to be ran over). There was little sympathy, explanation, or helpfulness from the agent. I called again today to follow up, and was put on with the same agent who simply told me \"I didn't open it yet\". I wanted to make sure everything was sent in correctly...I posted a complaint on Facebook and quickly got a response from their messenger representatives, who finally refunded my baggage fee of a mere $20.00, followed by a supervisor calling me at night. Although appreciated, my claim still won't be handled until later in the week. And guess what? The items WERE NOT SENT IN THE CORRECT FORMAT. I wasted 30 minutes on hold with her to not take 30 seconds to look and see if they were okay.I have items, brand new with tags for Christmas, that were missing from my baggage...I feel violated and disrespected. The rest were broken or damaged...I feel that my case has zero priority. A simple follow up saying \"we're working on it\" would suffice. I am not asking for a $10,000 check, I am simply asking for reimbursement with what THEY damaged, broke, or misplaced...and now I am thinking stolen.Being in customer service for the shipping department in my company, I understand how important these components are for the customer, especially when it is the company's liability that is being addressed. JetBlue is fully responsible for not only ruining my luggage, gifts for my family, an hour trip to and from the airport to redeem my luggage that was shipped on the following flight (not my original one), and over three hours of reporting all of my damages and finding receipts to file this report during my valued Christmas vacation with my family."}, {"date": "7/6/2017", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "$127 per bag!!! \u00a0 Any savings on ticket you MIGHT have made wiped out. \u00a0 It's a bait and switch. \u00a0They gotcha once you're at the airport. \u00a0 Come on a vacation with a few holiday clothes. \u00a0They ll ask you to move stuff to your carry on yeah right. \u00a0 \u00a0Sell a competitive priced ticket to the unsuspecting and ding their account ding ding ding all day at the airport with outrageous bag fees. \u00a0 \u00a0Good trick JetBlue. \u00a0 Fool me once shame on you. \u00a0Fool me twice not me back to Delta Airlines for me. \u00a0You had one chance"}, {"date": "10/13/2016", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Today, at the JFK airport, I found jetblue resembled Bank of America service.

But I can't travel to Hawaii any time soon in spite of free flights. Another reason is Jet \u00a0Blue USED TO have more leg room. I have not flown in \u00a0almost \u00a03 years so I can't speak for other airlines. But Jet Blues \u00a0planes have shrunk. I have \u00a0some health problems and \u00a0this was a trial run to see if flying \u00a0was okay for me.

This was not \u00a0Jet \u00a0Blues fault but the way they \u00a0handled it was. \u00a0We were stuck at the \u00a0airport in \u00a0Nola and \u00a0we had to wait for an FAA employee \u00a0to come \u00a0to the \u00a0airport to inspect the plane because he was at home. YES I SAID \u00a0AT HOME! It \u00a0was not \u00a0the \u00a0captains fault and upon leaving \u00a0the \u00a0captain \u00a0apologized he was so embarrassed. He said he didn't even know there were jobs \u00a0like that where you could be \u00a0at \u00a0home \u00a0and wait until the \u00a0airport calls you in. What is Jet Blues fault is we had to stay in our seats \u00a0and because the plane was so small and cramped it was painful and it \u00a0took me \u00a0about 5 days OR MORE \u00a0to return to normal \u00a0and had \u00a0to have \u00a0a 2 hour massage \u00a0and \u00a0acupuncture. If I wanted \u00a0to stay on \u00a0a plane for that \u00a0long \u00a0I would have \u00a0flown \u00a0somewhere further.The crew going to Nola was so nice. The crew returning was a Boston based crew and \u00a0was nice too especially the captain but the \u00a0lady flight attendant \u00a0was really \u00a0mad about the \u00a0situation and kind of treating \u00a0the \u00a0passengers \u00a0rudely because she was mad \u00a0to be \u00a0stuck. To be fair this was a plane full of entitled New Yorkers who were not nice to her either.The captain was nice and so was the male flight attendant.The \u00a0flight \u00a0attendants \u00a0 gave out as many \u00a0snacks as we \u00a0wanted. \u00a0(we meaning the \u00a0entire flight) Because of this the \u00a0bath room was a mess at take off.

It is not luxury air travel but they do treat you like a human being. They always have spacious seats on all flights. Seats recline reasonably, although could have been further. I do believe that seats are too firm and softer would be better.The flight attendants are always nice and not too overworked. Customer service is always good too. Never had a problem there. Snacks and drinks are better than average, however these days \"average\" means three peanuts and some recycled coffee. Paid meals are actually pretty good and not as expensive as one might imagine - typical $10 buys you a good quality small dinner and is well worth the convenience. The packaged wines aren't so great though. Flights are typically on time. Perhaps my JFK - LAX route is easy, but I never had a delayed flight.JetBlue honors TSA Pre-Check and that makes for a breeze screening at the airport. It is a great feature and I don't mind paying for the privilege - my last flight I checked in online, arrived to the airport 30 min before departure and still had time for a drink at Starbucks.Don't forget to download their app, then check in to get your electronic boarding pass - no paper! I am surprised so few people use this time saving feature. The biggest perk for all biz travelers like myself is free Wi-Fi. I absolutely love that feature and really don't care so much for the entertainment options. Lots of people like their TV but all I want is the Internet.

Flight B6 1334 leaving San Juan heading to Orlando April 20th 2017. Let me just start off by saying whoever is your hiring management they are clearly doing something right. The attendants were wonderful but one which I am positive he is the reason why all of them are so wonderful and is the perfect example of the person whoever you are surrounding yourself with your energy feeds off of them. Goes by the name Huntley. The second I had stepped on the plane I was cranky and overwhelmed with my heavy bags and upset that there was no room in the overhead bins and clearly he could tell. He told me to have a seat and he would make sure he would move stuff around so my stuff would be up front and I wouldn't have to worry about it, not only did he do that but it wasn't just for me the two ladies sitting next to me he did that for them as well. (Not to mention I was almost last when I got on the plane so imagine how many other people he had helped.) And when I was I was sleeping and woke up to use the restroom he said \" I saw you were sleeping didn't want to wake you up but what can I get you to drink\" I know that seems like it's a flight attendants job but honestly I haven't had any flight attendants that do that with as much as I fly. As for the baby crying behind us a couple rows back while everyone was sighing and annoyed with the baby he was trying to help the parents make the baby laugh. It's little things like that, that go noticed. Well we just landed and with that he got on the phone and said WAHOO and everyone clapped and laughed. Back to writing my review after getting off the plane I had told him he was wonderful and he had once again helped me get my bags and said it's people like you that make flights enjoyable and the guy behind me said he couldn't have agreed more.

His friend's family invited him to stay with them for few days. I purchased these tickets for him as a graduation present. He worked hard all 4 years in high school and got into good college. This is supposed to be his first vacation on his own. He was very excited about the trip. Before driving to the airport, I checked again the JetBlue website and the flight was delayed for 30 min (the delay was showing since morning). When we arrived at the Terminal, the flight was canceled, with no obvious reason. All other companies were flying to Orlando at the same time. We spent 3 hours 15 min. to get to the counter. No water, no food. Nobody explained or apologized to us for the cancellation. When we finally got to one of the JetBlue agents, he told us the flight's cancellation was not even reflected in the system. He also told that my son now has his ticket for the next day, Saturday 15th, at 9:40 pm. It was 30 hours later flight. \u00a0I said that it is not our fault and that they should find an earlier flight for my son. When I asked if JetBlue would provide a hotel or meal for this 30 hours wait, there was no answer from the agent (I do not mention that I had to pay a $39 parking ticket for the time we spent dealing with the situation). He didn't even try to accommodate my son, regardless the fact that there were two later flights this day and many flights in the morning next day. \u00a0JetBlue already decided that my son had to wait 30 hours.Knowing that low-cost companies are very reluctant to refund the money, I ask him in general if it is possible to do it. He pointed out on the customer service phone listed on the reservation. I was very upset and asked the agent to call the manager. \u00a0I never said that I want to cancel the tickets; I wanted to talk to someone with more authority willing to help my son with an earlier flight. After that, the agent started calling someone on the phone, without saying a word to us. I was sure he is looking for an alternative option for my son. I was sure that they would put him on the earlier flight even on the more expensive seat because they care about passengers and reputation. This is what a reputable and respectful company would do. After waiting for another 30 min., the agent who was on the phone put it down and said that the money will go back to my card. I could not believe my ears. He canceled my son's tickets without asking us! Right there in the airport, we tried to buy another ticket for my son. I found one $100 more and I was willing to pay this money, but it didn't go through. We came home and spent half of the night looking for other tickets - I would have to pay twice more while losing two days of vacation. We were not able to find anything. \u00a0I understand that there is a certain degree of less comfort, service, delays, etc. when you deal with a low-cost company. I understand that they cancel flights because they are just not full. But in this case, they must put passengers on other free seats, even more expensive first class seats. \u00a0I don't have much experience on domestic flights in the US, but I was flying many times in different countries in Europe (using low cost as well). The way JetBlue treated us is worse than companies in the 3d world countries treat their passengers.

Thank you for making flying reliable and pleasant."}, {"date": "2/10/2015", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "review": "JetBlue has always brought me to my destination safely and for that they deserve an automatic three stars in my book. However, anything exceeding a safe flight, like, I don't know, adequate customer service or something, is completely lacking or nonexistent. In the last 2-3 years or so, JetBlue has increased their prices significantly. Gas prices over the last few years have risen significantly, which is why this is legitimate, however in the last few months, gas prices have gone down, yet JetBlue prices have not. It blows my mind how airlines operate sometimes. There will be occasions where I need to book an emergency flight home from Buffalo to JFK and its $280 ONE WAY. GET OUT OF TOWN. Well that's always the plan, but I always find myself utilizing another method of transportation because that is just insanity. JetBlue would rather fly a plane with empty seats, then cut their prices in half a few hours before a flight takes off. I don't get it, never will. The mindset may be that if everyone knows JetBlue cuts their prices in half hours before a flight, then everyone will wait to book their flight until then and they will lose an immense amount of money. Guess what, JetBlue, that will NEVER happen. People don't like to wait until the last minute to book flights, they like plans, itineraries, organization. What will be beneficial for your corporation however, would be to reduce the rates of flights hours before so that people like me, in emergencies, can afford to come home when necessary without being broke afterwards. Over $500 for a round trip flight to JFK from Buffalo. Insanity I say.Perhaps, the insanity would be less if the customer service that was tied to JetBlue was appropriate, but it's not. My friend and I were flying together recently and the night before our flight, went to our e-mails to check in. Neither of us received an e-mail that our flights were cancelled, but instead had e-mails indicating new flight times. We were placed on two different flights, eight hours apart from one another. When we called to inquire why we never received e-mails about a cancellation we were given a really hard time, were being cut off every other word we were trying to say and the process was the opposite of smooth. They weren't doing anything to facilitate an easy flight and it was incredibly frustrating. They assured my friend, that by being placed on the 2 pm flight, it was the first one leaving JFK back to Buffalo. This was inaccurate considering I was put on the flight eight hours before that one back to Buffalo. The flight attendants that I have had on my flights lately have not been kind either. They have been moody and impatient. The gentleman sitting in front of me inquired with the flight attendant about whether or not they had coffee and her response was, \"I already said what your options were and coffee was one of them.\" DANGGGGGGG lady! Maybe he had headphones in or just didn't hear you. Not once did I see any of them smile. Flight attendants are supposed to make sure passengers feel safe on a flight as many are apprehensive about the idea. I rarely get that vibe \u00a0from JetBlue's flight attendants. I think there is a lot more that JetBlue can do to make sure peoples entire experience is enjoyable. I have had countless bag issues with JetBlue too. My latest being that an entire bottle of hairspray exploded all over everything in my bag. My suitcase was SOPPING wet when I pulled it off the belt. This bag had to literally have been tossed and slammed on the ground to enable the spray to explode over everything.

From the rude Jetblue counter people to the \"Greyhound\" like Jetblue terminal building at JFK. Which was absolutely filthy by the way. I don't think it is common for birds to fly around inside airport terminals. Perhaps most striking were the two homeless people sleeping in the terminal. Again I thought this was an airport not the Greyhound bus station. Having \"low fares\" seems to make a lot of other things low too. From service to the general classless and hostile atmosphere in the terminal. Oh yes and I should add that Gangsta rap was playing throughout the terminal building's sound system. Now to the fact of the matter. I traveled with two bags. One duffel backpackers bag and one laptop case. I was charged $100 usd for my duffel bag. The counter person was so rude to me I really felt disgusted from the start. The attitude given was that she's rather not do her job. Despite spending $100 dollars for a supposed overweight bag. I was then told that I would need to pay an additional $50 for my handcart. The cart was part of the bag and used to roll it around. It was explained that it would need to be checked as a separate bag. I was then later hassled about my laptop case. Security in the terminal was terrible, chaotic and unorganized. It looked like an episode of the three stooges. The staff at Jetblue were so busy talking to one another they felt it unnecessary to make their directions clear and understandable. On the flight one host, a 'male', was asked a question by a passenger. The question seemed to stump the host. However when an unsatisfactory resposne was given the passenger walked away upset. I witnessed the Jetblue host openly mock the passenger in front of everyone. In all of my years I have never seen this kind of behavior in a flight host.

It was a return flight, a long flight, and needless to say, after a Vegas conference, I am exhausted and ready to have a very relaxing flight home. When boarding the plane they made me check my carry on bag because it was a full flight although I purposely carried with a carry on only so I would not have to check a bag, I complied with them, allowing them to put it with the items that could be picked up at the gate when we land (strollers etc.).I go to sit down in my seat (aisle) and the Flight Attendant Jen is in my seat greeting passengers. I stopped and said Hi that is my seat and waited for her to respond which she did not. I walked slightly past the seat to let her out and again said Sorry, you are in my seat. She became openly agitated and snapped at me and said \"well I have to get out of it before you can get in it right? I was pretty stunned so I said nothing and she again says \"RIGHT?\" making me respond with a yes of course. She gets out of the seat and SLAMS the overhead bin across from me mutters B**** under her breathe and storms down the aisle. I was visibly shaken and I look to the passenger across from me and he asked me \"did you just hear what she said?\" I asked him what he heard and he goes \"she just called you a B****\". At this point I am shaking, I am nervous and unsure of what to do especially with the recent media about speaking up for yourself on flights. I was also on the flight with coworkers who were in different aisles and would have been mortified if a scene was made. Luckily, the guy next to me made me feel better and also ended up being a subject of Jen's terror. She was very rude in her service and he whispered something to his wife when she walked away and Jen must have heard and made it a point to turn around and ask this man \"I'm sorry, do you have a question for me?\". At this point he turned towards me and basically insinuated we both better just stare forward the rest of this flight. To top it all off, when I got off the plane my baggage was not there. I asked the JetBlue employee in the terminal where it was and she told me it got checked. I clarified with her what she meant, told her it was not supposed to be checked it was supposed to be at the gate, and she said no all the items were checked. I went to pick up my bag at baggage claim and it was not checked, it was at the gate, and they had to chase down my baggage. I did call to let JetBlue know about this experience and they put in a \"formal investigation\" whatever that entails, and also credited me $50 towards my next flight. I was recently discussing this issue with my family over the holidays and they felt even that service/refund is unacceptable. I agree.

Nothing was put on the outside of the box, or on the outside of my luggage indicating the need for \"special handling\". \u00a0I pointed out at that time that procedure did not seem normal. \u00a0The response was, \"it is managed differently at different airports\". \u00a0Additionally, she failed to enter the corresponding declaration slip number in to their tracking system. \u00a0The bag was sent to security and \u00a0loaded on the plane. l was told that everything was fine and to enjoy my flight. \u00a0I had a layover at JFK. \u00a0In NY, TSA pulled me out of boarding, concerned that I had not declared the handgun in my luggage. \u00a0Jet Blue's security person, a TSA officer, and two NY Port Authority officers spent the next several hours interrogating me, causing me to miss my connection to Austin. \u00a0At this point I was extremely upset at the realization that I was facing two possible felonies in the City of New York. \u00a0New York has extremely strict handgun laws. \u00a0They explained that my bag should have gone directly to the next plane and never should have entered the terminal at JFK. \u00a0When it did, TSA immediately saw the handgun, did not find in the computer system that it had been declared, and my hell began. \u00a0I spent hours with Jet Blue security, TSA security and NY Port Authority. \u00a0I had texted my husband telling him TSA was removing me from my flight. He was EXTREMELY concerned as he too understood immediately the severity of the situation. \u00a0My luggage was finally brought up to the security gate in JFK. l opened the gun safe box, and the signed declaration slip was indeed in it! \u00a0Now the concern was how to get me and the gun home to Austin. \u00a0The on duty Jet Blue manager was able to secure a seat for me on a 5:10 pm flight with American Airlines. \u00a0American Airlines ticket counter was two terminals away from the Jet Blue terminal. \u00a0Somehow I was supposed to get myself and the handgun to that terminal legally in the state of New York! \u00a0I was terrified that once I got to the America Airlines terminal, I would have to go through this nightmare again at their ticket counter with TSA and the Port Authority Officers.Fortunately things went relatively smoothly with American Airlines with the exception that Jet Blue had not paid for my ticket and that now had to be straightened out. \u00a0I did have to pay American's $25 bag fee. \u00a0Please note, I had already paid Jet Blue's $25 bag fee as well. \u00a0The NY Port Authority officer in the Jet Blue terminal had called over to the officer at the American Airlines terminal and he was aware of the situation. \u00a0American entered in to the system the correct declaration of the handgun, and put a red tag on the outside of my luggage, indicating \"special handling,\" as well as locking the declaration slip inside the gun safe box. There were no further problems and I finally made it home 12 hours after I had landed in NY.It is difficult to accurately put in to words the terror I was experiencing through the entire ordeal. \u00a0On the outside I was cool and polite as I understood that expressing my deep seated anger and fear would only make things worse. \u00a0On the inside, scenarios of federal felony charges and prison were shaking me to the core. \u00a0My husband was also afraid for me and experience one of the most stressful days of his life!Once home, I called to express my deep seated displeasure about this experience to Jet Blue's complaint line. \u00a0I was politely offered $50 for my trouble. \u00a0That just rubbed salt in the wound. \u00a0At a minimum, I would expect that not only my costs for this trip would be reimbursed, but I should also receive something to compensate for all of the terror and stress that my husband and I were put through."}, {"date": "3/10/2014", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "This is my favorite NYC terminal.

JetBlue told us several times all flights were delayed. Crowd control was non existent, people cutting the line, didn't know where to go, mass confusion. Two hours later we get to the front of the line and turns out it was due to JetBlue not having enough people to process travelers. The TSA lines were non existent.

I travel often on business and have been on most of the major airlines, but still, none compares to JetBlue for the comfort and service that this brand offers.The fleet features newer planes too. Now with even more destinations that they travel to it makes it an easier choice when planning a trip for business or pleasure. Flight costs are relatively still lower then many of the other airlines, and they constantly run special sales and deals, so it is worth it to sign up on their website to get the emails from them. First checked bag is still free.And we all know about the terrific Terminal 5!Plus, they have an amazing basket of free snacks and goodies to choose from to munch on during your flight, and you can take as much as you want!

We had confirmed our flight on Jet Blue's own app the day before the flight, checked our bags at the curb, and received a boarding pass from Jet Blue. \u00a0Therefore, Jet Blue was on notice that we were getting on the flight and could have easily sent us a message that we were absolutely required to board the ten minutes earlier than our stated 8:52 flight time. \u00a0I signed up for alerts on the app, yet received absolutely no warning they would shut the doors on me abruptly and early! \u00a0I continually checked my phone after I arrived at the airport, but received nothing but an email sent at exactly 8:52, when it was too late to board our flight! \u00a0Why did Jet Blue choose to send an alert when it says we could not have gotten on the plane? 3. \u00a0I am a Jet Blue TrueBlue customer with Jet Blue's own app that I downloaded specifically to prevent problems, and I enabled the location detector along with the alerts. \u00a0What is it for, just to track our every movement and sell our info, because it was certainly not used for my benefit on the day of my flight! \u00a0Jet Blue could have easily sent alerts early, but chose not to. \u00a04. Jet Blue employees at the gate could easily see that the seats in the plane were not all taken yet, but chose to abruptly cut off the missing passengers. \u00a0They could have seen that there were people who had boarding passes (and had checked luggage outside) yet were not seated yet. \u00a0Jet Blue employees could have easily refrained from shutting the doors on us before the stated 8:52 flight time, yet consciously chose to shut us out of our flight! \u00a0This is nasty customer service - from an airline that is supposed to be a cut above in terms of service!5. \u00a0Please don't tell me it is impossible or illegal to put the correct flight time on the ticket. \u00a0Please don't tell me that it is impossible not to close the doors ten minutes too early either. \u00a0On our later flight that day, the doors were left open well after the end of the boarding line. \u00a0There were several stragglers who walked onto the plane several minutes behind the line (I had my phone out, keeping track of the time). \u00a0 The flight crew made sure everyone was on board before asking each other if it was time to close the doors. \u00a0The doors weren't closed 10 minutes before the flight time, the customers were accommodated properly. \u00a0So, please don't insult our intelligence and claim that putting the correct flight time on the ticket, or keeping the doors open until at least the stated flight time, is impossible!There are many legitimate, understandable delays in air travel that customers try to deal with. \u00a0What is unacceptable is to arrive on time for your flight, only to find out that the flight time was not the real time, that the airline is playing games to trip up customers - and gain some change fees in the process! - and that Jet Blue employees are bureaucrats that couldn't care less about the customer. \u00a0What should have been a routine, pleasant trip becomes an unnecessary delay that wastes half your day killing time in the airport with your child - because of Jet Blue's callousness."}, {"date": "3/26/2016", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Ever wanted substandard service?

It was a brand new set. When I went to baggage claim my suitcase was wet, had dirt on it and the frame was dented in. I could no longer pull out the handle to row it around. The frame was bent so far in that it punctured a shampoo bottle I had inside. Thank goodness I had the bottle in a ziplock bag that contained most of the mess. But it still got on some of my clothes.

Let's break it down:The Good: Lots o legroom, distracting TVs for us nervous flyers, free snacks, super friendly (but not obnoxiously over-friendly) flight attendants, great prices from BUF to JFK and really great prices from JFK to about anywhere, and free checked bag. Yay. The Bad: not competitive with some of the southeast airlines to the point where I've been forced to fly Airtran because of upwards of a $300 cheaper roundtrip. This makes me sad, I hate Airtran. I feel like Jetblue should be able to fly the east coast cheaper than that. The Ugly: Although Terminal 5 at JFK is beautiful and has lots of things to keep you happy, getting through bag check and security is such a nightmare I've only had time once to enjoy the terminal - during a connecting flight delay. The employees working bag check are usually miserable and chatting amoungst each other and the TSA is a complete nightmare there (I know that isn't Jetblue's fault, per se... but I can't help but think a re-design for passengers with special needs could really help move the rest of us along nicely).

Because Mardi Gras is fun. When I got to JFK early that morning, my flight was delayed, thanks to an oncoming blizzard. The JetBlue people swore up and down that we would be taking off at some point that day, and to just bear with them. But of course, that was untrue. After being pushed back numerous times, my flight was eventually canceled, and I was relegated to trying to get on one leaving the next day. Late as it was, it didn't make sense for me to go home for a couple hours only to return, so I endured the worst night's sleep I've ever had on the JFK floor. The next morning, I miraculously scored the last spot on a New Orleans flight via standby, and I gratefully boarded the plane. My triumph was shortlived. Minutes later, a flight attendant walked up the aisle like Tom Hanks breaking the news of a dead husband in A League of Their Own. She stopped next to me, not Geena Davis, and I sobbed on her shoulder as she escorted me off the plane. What was infuriating about the whole situation was the fact that I wasn't vacating my seat for another person. Apparently, the woman whose seat I had claimed refused to give it up, even though she was not getting on the flight. The airline people were as baffled as I was.This woman was not at the airport. So obviously, she was not getting on the flight to sit in the seat she had reserved. JetBlue had given her two options:1. Receive a refund, and allow me to board the flight.2. Refuse a refund, and INSIST that the flight take off with her seat unoccupied.She went with Option 2, and is obviously evil incarnate. I had been sitting in a seat, ready to rock out at the Gras, and I had to walk out, and watch the plane take off without me. WITH NO ONE SITTING IN THE SEAT.At this point, I had been in JFK for over 24 hours, and I was irritable. All I wanted was to drink myself silly at parades, and revel with thousands of other degenerates. In an attempt to avoid my wrath, JetBlue put me at the top of the standby list for the next flight, all but ensuring I would get on the flight. And when I did finally board, fate had placed me one seat away from Eli Manning. A NOLA native, I imagine he was just trying to get on whatever flight he could home, and there's no first class on JetBlue. It's very democratic. Keep in mind that this was about a month after the New York Football Giants got bounced from the playoffs by the Eagles, and poor Eli was receiving shit from nearly every fan that recognized him. He looked the way he does after throwing an interception. This guy knows what I'm talking about.Feeling sorry for the man, I told him I was a big fan, and had him sign my boarding pass, to show that there were no hard feelings. Confidence restored, one year later young Eli would lead the Giants to the greatest SuperBowl victory ever against the detestable New England Patriots. Undoubtedly a direct result of autographing my boarding pass.You might be asking yourself, \"Why is he telling me this story? More importantly, why have I wasted five minutes out of my day reading this inanity?\"Well, in about eight years of flights, this was the only bad experience I've had with JetBlue. The only hiccup in years of comfortable seats, direct flights, and in-flight DirectTV. It is the exception that proves the rule. That blizzard was a terrible situation that, to be sure, the company handled poorly. But they have redeemed themselves since. After numerous calls to customer service, they eventually refunded my money for the flight, and gave me a voucher for an additional flight as well. So we're cool. And more importantly, had this whole fiasco never taken place, the Patriots would have gone 19-0, and we never would have heard the end of it from Boston; we should all be grateful for that blizzard.And so, I continue to fly JetBlue whenever possible. (Unless Virgin America is available, because they have in-flight wi/fi, and I'm a slave to the internets.)"}, {"date": "8/17/2014", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "I only gave this airline one star because I couldn't give no stars. I will start by saying that I booked my flight with JetBlue because of the free first bag checked in deal. I was very exciting and interested to see what my experience would be like. Due to circumstances beyond my control I arrived at the airport at 6:30am for a flight that was leaving at 7:29am. We stood on the curb side check in line which was extremely long. I ended up leaving my husband there and went inside to speak to the airline personnel. I showed by boarding pass and explained how my flight was leaving soon and was told that I had to wait on line. I asked which line was best and was told that it was up to me. Being that my husband was already on line we continued to wait on the line outside and the line was shorter. When we got to the front of the line we were told that we had just missed out flight. I was confused because it was now 7a.m and it was 29 mins until the flight left. I was told to go inside. I went inside and spoke to the same young man I had spoken to who now directed me to window 10. When I got to window 10 I was told that nothing could get done because we had been late. I explained that we had gotten there with enough time to make the flight but the line had been long. I was then told that the outside line had nothing to do with the inside line. I was confused because I had specifically inquired to avoid missing my flight. No apology was ever offered. In fact the manager of the lines (Sean) made it a point to express that he was in charge and nothing was going to be done to accommodate us. He told us that we had to rebook and sent us to the back of the line. I explained that we had already stood on line and he didn't care. Mind you we needed to be on the plane to get to our cruise all he said was next time be on time. I have never dealt with such unprofessionalism and a lack of regard for a customer.

Keep in mind that there was expected to be bad weather this day beginning around 10am. We continuously heard announcements that the flight was going to be delayed. We approached flight attendants at the gate asking what the issue was. We were told that the co-pilot had not yet arrived and we kept receiving invalid updates as to why we were waiting. The snow began to fall at 10am which at that time, we should have been an hour into our flight. At approximately 1pm we boarded the plane after a replacement co-pilot had arrived. We had to spend our entire morning and some of our afternoon in the airport because of this matter. It was almost 8pm when we arrived at our hotel. An entire day lost of our vacation. I contacted jet blue upon my return from my vacation and explained the situation to a customer service representative and they determined that a $50.00 credit towards another jet blue flight was sufficient enough to resolve this matter. In my opinion, $50.00 for the ordeal that my fianc\u00e9 and I encountered is an insult and certainly does not compensate me for the $250.00 day I lost at my resort and the $50-100 I spent on food and beverages at the airport.

Having previously lived in San Francisco and making many cross country trips to visit family on the east coast, we solely flew on JetBlue. And now living on the east coast and doing the reverse trip several times a year, I'm happy to say that we are sticking with our favorite airline. I can not imagine making the six hour flight without a tv. It's a great distraction, makes the time fly by, and generally keeps everyone in a pretty good mood. The seats are spacious, the crews are always friendly and helpful, and they still give out snacks. While I'm sure I could fly cheaper, I consider all that I'm getting with my ticket price and always fly JetBlue. They have a decent frequent flyer program and I've used points many times to purchase tickets. They also recently introduced a family plan for miles and points which is such a great idea! I will say that we have run into some situations with delays (both mechanical and weather) and they always do their best to respond to complaints and make things right. On a flight earlier this year I was stuck in JFK for 6 hours with my two year old son. I tweeted them throughout the ordeal and they were prompt to respond. While it didn't change the delay time (mechanical issues), I walked away from the experience feeling a little tired but overall impressed with their customer service and willingness to make things right.

Apparently the cheapest flight had a return flight arriving at JFK at almost 11 pm at night. I thought, great a light night train ride or find someone to give me a ride. A couple of years ago that would not have been a problem but this time it was. So I arranged transportation and forgot about that detail. Going to Orlando: On the day of my departing flight I get to JFK with over 2 hours to spare. The check in was uneventful. I get to the gate and see lots of people waiting. Plenty of free snacks and nonalcoholic beverages. The flight itself was uneventful. Thankfully! Return trip: I get to Orlando International and after a confusing security check I get to my gate. One thing though. When I check in with JetBlue, I was told that seats were not assigned so I would have to wait at the gate to get a new boarding pass instead of the one printed initially when I checked in with Jetblue. I get to the gate and I don't see any employee there. So I decide to get a drink. I go to Kafe Kalik for a beer and wait and relax. When I am done with my beer I get back to the gate and there is one employee there. So I ask her about the boarding bass and seat assignment situation. She said they will print out new ones and call our names before boarding. About 10 minutes before boarding they do so, in no particular order. Once again actually flight was uneventful.

Why do I say this?1) A really nice guy ended up helping me manhandle my luggage into the bin (just as he did his) and she let me through without batting a lash. Clearly my luggage wasn't overflowing to a dangerous point. It fit the standard dimensions. At that moment, she wasn't spiting me to fulfill her security duties; she was spiting me just because she could. In the end, I just felt profiled against for being a small, Asian girl traveling alone. 2) This was the same carry-on I had flown with into JFK on JetBlue. Clearly, it was not of danger to the plane and as expected, it fit into the overhead bins just as well as it did the first time. There was plenty of space in the bins in general, probably because her actions had brought so many other carry-ons into the check-in cargo area. I wish I could say I was grateful I'd gotten through, but it just left a sour taste in my mouth. 3) After I passed security, I became hyperaware of people's carry-on sizes around me and there honestly wasn't any difference between mine and theirs.Thank goodness that was my flight home, but the stress and discomfort was completely unnecessary.

If I bumped into someone, I probably would just have knocked them over....hard. I pass up Tameka on my way back and she screams \"your bag is with your friend! I saw you run back but I couldn't stop you!!\" I thanked her the best I could with minimal stopping and kept on going. I am really sorry I didn't get his name, but an young Asian male employee jumped up at the sight of me, ran to the gate to open it up, ran us thru the on-ramp to open the second door--in high dramatic affair--and the plane was still there!!I was sweating and panting and probably getting dirty looks from other passengers, but I still made it! All because of the efforts of this incredible staff @ Gate 14 & TSA! I tried shooting Jetblue an email, commending their staff and I do really hope Tameka, Alfredo and the nice gentleman all get word of how much I truly appreciate their help in my stressful situation.

The issue that I ran into was with my carry on bag. I was actually flying to Fort Lauderdale to move, so I brought one checked bag and one carry on bag. My carry on had all of my valuables, including my laptop, camera, iPad, etc (all of the things that I wanted to make sure were with me at all times). When I checked my bag, the person that was helping me looked at my carry on bag and said that I would be fine. I went through security and was sitting in the terminal waiting to board my plane. When boarding, the staff scanned my boarding pass and told me that I was good to go. I walked past them to board the plane and they stopped me, telling me that my carry on was too big and that I would not be able to bring it with me as a carry-on. I told them that the person that checked my bag said that my bag would be fine. The boarding staff told me that we will be flying on a smaller plane. They said that on a normal JetBlue plane, my bag would have fit, but because we were flying on a smaller plane, it was not going to fit. They told me that I could take it on and try, but I would not succeed. By the time that this whole commotion was over and I got on the plane, most of the carry-on bins were full and closed. I couldn't get my bag up into the bin. The staff on the plane saw me struggling and did not offer to help. I ended up getting frustrated and realizing that my bag was not going to fit, so I let them take it as a checked bag. I was anxious the whole flight because my electronics and things were not properly padded with clothes or anything, and I was nervous that my bag would be tossed around. Had I known earlier that I would not be able to take my carry-on with me on the plane, I would have taken more clothes from my other luggage and padded my electronics. All of my belongings ended up being okay and nothing was broken, but I did not have any piece of mind during the whole flight because I was so nervous about my things. I wish somebody would have just told me from the beginning that I could not take my carry-on with me, and I would have prepared better.

They are immaculately clean and have everything from multiple high end restaurants and stores to quick and easy food and regular gift shops. The prices are a tad high though especially in their restaurants (think Yankee Stadium prices on their beer or burgers). If you haven't been to JFK before it's not like most airports, there are 8 terminals and most of the major airlines have their own terminals. If you're not driving the AirTrain will bring you to the terminal of your choice. My only issue about their terminal other than the prices is about their security check. It had been many years since I had been through a security checkpoint, when I was approaching the line and the x-ray machines I was looking for signs to tell me what I had to take out of my pockets and what wasn't allowed, there were no signs. I was taken aside after the security check and my bag was checked again because I left my laptop in my luggage. The woman told me I should have been watching the TV screens \"all over the airport\" which would have told me. Now I consider myself a pretty observant person and I was looking around quite a bit but I never had my attention drawn to any of these TV screens she was referring to and there certainly wasn't any signs or TVs near the security checkpoint line. The JetBlue planes are also quite clean and the best part is they have a small screen with DirectTV and Satellite Radio on every headrest where you can control the 40 or so channels (over 100 of radio) and volume on your armrest. My only issue with their planes is even though JetBlue advertises WiFi not only in the terminal but on their planes not all of their planes have WiFi (neither of my planes had it). All in all, I had no issues booking a trip, getting to and around the terminal or while on the plane.

He is deeply afraid of dogs from a past traumatic experience. He politely asked the flight attendant to be moved to an acceptable seat or to have the man with the dog moved. When that didn't happen, I explained to the FA that the dog had to be kept in front of the owner, not in the aisle. (This was clearly going to be a problem since the large dog didn't fit under the seats.) There were two competing emotional needs: the owner's to be with the dog and my seat-mates to be without the dog. The plane (although full) was big enough to accommodate everyone. Yet JetBlue decided to remove both me and my seatmate (who I had never met before in my life). They would not make any attempt to appease us. And they made no effort to get us out on another flight (they said the soonest I could travel, instead of 10 am Friday, was 9:40 pm on Saturday...to a different airport). I am shaken by my treatment.

This airline is good only in ideal conditions.I was flying from OAK (California) to JFK via NON-STOP red eye flight 9:30 PM reaching JFK 5:30 AM. The flight boarding time was 9:00 PM so I reached at the airport at 8:00 PM. Then someone from staff makes announcement at 9:00PM that there is some computer problem in aircraft so flight will be delayed by 30 minutes. And after every 30 min they kept repeating delay of 30 min or an hour. Then finally at 3:00 AM staff announced that there is a possibility that flight will be cancelled, but still not confirmed so next update will be in an hour. Staff told us to call the 1-800* number to rebook \u00a0but 1-800 people kept telling that they cant do anything until the flight is officially gets cancelled. So they kept us hanging. Then finally at 4:00 AM (after spending 7 hours at airport without sleep) they announced the cancellation. Then the real mess started, as how they handled this scenario. They gave other choices to few people, alternate flights were from different airport and they were not confirming if they would be able to provide transportation to the other airport. some people got so frustrated that they shared the cab to reach to the different airport and paid from their own pocket. For me, they could not find any immediate flight options, so they gave another flight for next day at 11:00 PM. so I still have 17 hours to go before i board on my next flight. They were still figuring out if they can provide us hotel or not. That took another hour. Finally they gave us the hotel at 6:00 AM in morning (BUT ON CONDITION THAT CHECK OUT TIME WILL BE 12:00 PM) and i will have no place to stay after 12:00 PM for 10 hours until my next flight.

I grew up as part of a United-only family, but JetBlue has really won me over. It can take a little searching and some good timing, but I generally find their prices to be extremely reasonable. But the big thing that really gets me is the fact that now, when thinking about a trip in advance, I actually LOOK FORWARD TO flying! I have never had a bad experience booking or checking in with them. In fact, the employees always seem incredibly nice and genuine (nice enough to give this college student all the time she needed to organize her huge suitcases full of dorm-clothes so that they were under the weight limit). (Not having to pay for a checked bag is a HUGE plus, too!) They are also incredibly accommodating - I remember one time when they had to hold us on the ground to de-ice the plane for maybe an extra 25 min (which, in the world of travel is barely even a blimp on the radar), and as \"compensation\" they gave everyone on the plane free, unlimited access to their movies!Other bonuses include the great in-flight service and accommodations. Even without paying you have personal tv screens with access to great, current tv shows. Then come out the free sodas/coffee/juice etc, and the snacks! What other airline still gives you tasty, unlimited, FREE snacks? They never begrudge you an extra cookie, bag of chips, or selection of crackers. It's just truly great service. Beyond all of that, I am part of their rewards program and am very happy with the options and flexibility that it gives me. I can share my points with other airlines, and they offer lots of ways to earn extra points! I would love to give them 4 1/2 stars if I could. My only critique is that while the scope of where they fly is great, a lot of places can only be reached through very specific routes. Luckily I usually fly out of NYC (which is a huge hub), but I can see it being a little challenging to find appropriate flights otherwise. But keep up the great work JetBlue! Keep those air travel standards high!"}, {"date": "1/28/2009", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "I gots to give JetBlue the props they deserve. While it's fashionable to rank on airlines because of delays (and when are we not delayed most times at an airport?), I think one needs to look past what is unavoidable and talk about what makes a good airline experience.My recent trip to Nassau experience was as follows:1. Cost: The price was right, $350 including taxes and fuel charges, round trip, non-stop. Beat that with a stick. There was one non-stop fare better on Delta, and it was out of LGA, but I wonder if I'd still be sitting on the tarmac a week later had I taken that flight instead. LGA sucks.2. Ease of booking: Their website makes it fairly easy to book. There are a few navigational issues on the site that I would correct, but overall, the web experience was good. Book your ticket, pick your seats, voil\u00e1.3. JFK: Now, I know that it's almost required to bitch about this airport, but quite frankly, I think from the dark, ghetto days of ten years ago, JFK has made dramatic improvements. People like to pretend it's so far out in the boonies, when in reality, it's really not that far. Without traffic (and fer chrissakes plan your flights during non-rush hour times if you can help it, sheesh) it is just over 20 minutes from my front door by car. Given that we're in the largest city in the country, this is pretty outstanding. Yes, it sucks when the traffic is bad, but so does going four blocks in midtown Manhattan, and we don't slag the entire borough for that, now do we? And if we do, well, MOVE TO NEW JERSEY AND DON'T COME BACK ON THE WEEKEND AND POLLUTE OUR BARS. Thanks. They have steadily been improving JFK with new terminals, retrofitting old ones, and at least attempting to make it easier to access. If I have one pet peeve, it's that there's no direct access to JFK from midtown directly, you have to take a subway to the monorail or a bus. THAT, my friends, is lame. If you want to complain about something, complain about that, and blame it on stupid Giuliani, who is busy tooting his horn about being \"the man\" in a crisis, but wanted to put Yankee Stadium on the west side and couldn't get a deal done to directly link our major airport to downtown. Thanks for nothing. YES, I AM RANTING.3. Terminal 5: I think it's possible there could be a nicer terminal, but I'm really not sure how. Given the size of the terminal, the number of flights in and out, the gates are very accessible. It is also stocked with excellent vendors. Screw Cinnabon and McDonalds, they have Jamba Juice. No better way to start the morning.4. Check-in: was really a snap, even given that I had an international flight.They got my bags checked and things moved fast (and for a dive trip, I'm carrying a lot of luggage). First bag (under 50 pounds) is free. I realize that even having to give the idea of a \"free bag\" props is weird, given that the industry standard for years was the first two bags under 70 pounds were free, but this is the state of things. Second bag is $20 bucks. Completely reasonable in this day and age. Third bag starts to get steep at $75. For dive trips I'm usually toting 150 pounds of stuff with me, so I care about this. The night before my trip, I'm generally putting my bags on a scale and moving pairs of socks from bag to bag to keep under the weight limits. I carry four carry-ons to get around the weight restrictions and they generally never hassle me.5. Boarding: was on time. But ya know, sometimes airlines can't help but be late. They're subject to all the other crap that's happening at another airport that delays a plane, like weather, stupidity or gross weaselicissitude. YES, I said it. 6. Flight: Smooth and airy. Fast and delicious. OH, and BONUS: No water landing!7. In-flight amenities: \u00a0While their snacks are good, the portions kinda suck. This is where a star comes off. Give me a decent bag of chips, wouldja? Not the \"fun\" size. This isn't Halloween. On a side note, I never understood the canceling of meals on flights. \u00a0If I can buy a sandwich on a plane for five bucks, how about they just add that onto the ticket price and WE ALL EAT. Jeezus.Post flight: They sent me a survey asking about all of the above. They even asked if the greetings I was offered by the flight crew were satisfactory. Now that's service.I'd recommend JetBlue, even if only for the new Terminal at JFK. You can buy an iPod in a vending machine there.

I live in upstate NY, and JetBlue is a very dominant airline here, but I often drive for 5-6 hrs just to make sure I get where I need to go without being hassled, stuck on a runway or at the airport for hours, or bad customer service experience, even though flying into JFK would have been more convenient. \u00a0I even started using Toronto airport for long haul flights (3 hr drive from where I live), just not to be stuck with JetBlue."}, {"date": "7/4/2009", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "Flying out of Ft.

I would give zero stars if yelp had that option! At JFK I'm hoping someone will put up that big GIANT RAT when businesses are being protested in NYC. \u00a0In the meantime we have Yelp and Google reviews and from the looks of it, I'm surprised Shit Blue is sill in business with so many negative reviews and complaints (over half!!). Why do we pay so much for the worst customer service??!! Like so many other reviews STICK WITH VIRGIN where you are always treated like royalty! Because Virgin and AA were all booked up, I flew Shit Blue because I WAS DESPERATE not because I chose too (let me be clear about that) and had no other choice. At JFK, nothing has changed - their reps are JFK's rudest. My Chihuahua is looking this jackass right in the eye and he doesn't say anything!

They let me try it and it didn't fit. But the door already closed and the middle seat was empty. I thought it was cool to simply keep the dog in his case sitting right next to me. NO WAY! \u00a0They had the balls to make me go back outside and FORCED me to purchase their \"Dogie Luggage\" caring case AFTER I WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE OK AND NOT A PROBLEM-GUESS WHAT - HE LIED!!!

He went unnoticed for about 3hrs. The female attendants saw him and said nothing but the fat ass male attendant insisted that I put the dog back in the carrier. So back in the carrier he goes and for the next hour and a half he CLAWED SO VIOLENTLY THAT HIS CLAWS STARTED TO BLEED!! \u00a0I took him out again and that fat-fuck attendant said I will be fined if I don't put him back! I didn't want to cause a scene so back he went ) : \u00a0As soon as we touched down I told the pilot that I will never fly in this piece of shit plane again. \u00a0I took my dog to a 24hr. veterinary hospital here in San Jose. \u00a0He was treated and released with medication for PAIN and of course another 100 bucks. When I called Shit Blue and explained everything, same bitchy attitude from the CS rep and a \"tuff shit Sherlock\" attitude from the Supervisor.

Now that you became all grown-n-sexy, I found myself riding your roomy butter leather seats for 9 hours straight, from here to San Francisco...despite the (industry-wide) rise in airfare, due to fees from: -fuel charges-exit-row seats-headphones, pillows and blankets-and the 2nd checked bag.But I still gotta say nay to the faulty tv hook-ups; 1/3 of the people on my SFO-NYC flight couldn't watch their tvs.Other than that, can we talk, boo?

I had always wanted to ride on jet blue but they're usually more expensive to NY than Virgin, so I hadn't until now. I travel about 7 times a year, mostly nationally but also internationally. I try to stick with Virgin America and have flown Virgin more times than I can count and have never had a bad experience. But this review is not about Virgin, it's about Jet Blue, which I will never be flying again and I'll tell you why. My plane was scheduled to leave NY at 5:15pm and we left at 10:30pm. Yes there was a 5 hour delay because \"the weather was bad\" - an understandable fact - HOWEVER..... and this is where Jet Blue loses me... We were given misinformation the entire time. At first we were told we had an hour delay, then 2. Then no announcement was made at all but the time on the screen changed to yet another hour delay. At one point we were told our plane was circling overhead trying to land. Then we were told it had to go to Baltimore. A couple of hours later we learned all of that had been untrue and our plane had never left Atlantic City. Now where I get tiffed off is when I'm lied to and given the wrong information. Some things can't be helped, we all understand that but not to be told what's going on and to be lied to and led to believe something that's not true... that's where integrity (or the lack of) comes into play. All of the jet blue planes were delayed, not just ours, however all the other planes were delayed by 1 or 2 hours and they all landed and they all took off and we kept being told our plane could not land b/c of the weather, when the plane at the terminal next to ours landed fine. It was easy to realize, after 4 hours of this crap that we were being lied to. When the plane finally did arrive they did not make any announcements, we just stood there for an hour wondering what was going on as disgruntled people started getting off the plane. When they finally began the boarding process, the girl at the front told us what rows were boarding but she didn't use the loud speaker so no one could hear her and everyone got confused and kept asking each other \"why isn't she using the loud speaker? We can't hear a word she is saying\" so I finally went to the front just as she was announcing again without the loud speaker. I said to her, \"excuse me but no one can hear you, can you please use the loud speaker?\" and she actually snapped at me!!! She got a nasty attitude and all bitchy and said \"I can't use it until the other person stops using it\" and at that moment someone else was announcing something for another gate, but the first 2 times she announced, no one else was using it. And that ladies and gentlemen was the final straw for me and the reason Jet Blue gets 1 instead of 2 stars. The staff is rude to their customers after lying to us and delaying our flight for 5 hours?!?!? Oh right, it's OUR fault because we spent $250 for a one way ticket to HELL.... Of course!!! I was shocked and pissed. 3 minutes later she announced more rows, again w/no loudspeaker (and no no one else was using it) and again, no one in the back could hear her. Completely unprofessional! I've learned the hard way that Jet Blue seems to have the opposite credo that you learn as a good customer service rep - At Jet Blue it seems: \"the customer is always wrong\". After I boarded the plane I asked one of the stewards something and I wasn't being mean but I was still upset at how I had been treated and so I said, \"you know the Jet Blue lady outside yelled at me\" and he said, \"Oh I see, you're a trouble maker.\" WTF???? I can only assume their employees are trained in \"how to be exceptionally rude to customers and piss them off\" - I honestly have never been treated so badly for $250!!! The pluses are more leg room and lumbar support on the seat/s. Free TV and movies and so F-ing what when you're treated like crap and have to wait 5 hours to leave. Virgin is where it's at. The people are nice. They have wifi, you can plug in your laptop or other device and charge up and I doubt they had 5 hour delays tonight. So yeah if you want to be abused and pay for it, plus wait for hours and hours in a very uncomfortable airport - choose Jet Blue!!!Or you can pay $35+ per year and get their credit card. Oh did I mention Virgin America's credit card doesn't have a yearly fee?On the plane they blasted the AC for the first 2 hours so they could SELL you a blanket and pillow (to use, not to keep). Great way to take care of your customers guys!And lastly, we weren't able to tell the people picking us up when we were going to land b/c the pilot didn't tell us before we took off so I told my boyfriend to check the website or call. And he informed me that they never even bothered to update their website so it said the plane was landing on time.

Then again it doesn't really require a lot to work there, but they just like to go as slow as possible and hell they know you ain't going nowhere till they decide it.

I booked a trip to Boston, MA from Jacksonville, FL to go to the New York Jets vs New England patriots football game on Thursday 10/16/14. My flight was due to arrive into Boston Logan at 2:30 PM and I was departing back to Jacksonville at 8:30 AM the next day so it is obvious that the football game was teh only reason for my trip. I prepaid for my hotel through priceline at $110.89 and 2 tickets to the game for a total of $334.00. I arived at the airport in JAX to find nobody to help me at the ticket counter, which had a sign that read Boston 12:00 on time. The sign stayed like this until 12:07 when a JetBlue representative came out and said \"The pilot hit the jetway and dented teh engine, we are calling our ops center to see if t here is another plane or if they are cancelling.\" I immediately called 1-800-jet-blue to seek alternate arrangements and was told \"we are not showing this flight is cancelled and cannot do anything until it officially is.\" I then waited until 1:12 pm, when the flight was officially cancelled, I called back and waited 41 minuted for a supervisor and was told by her that there was not other way to get me to or around Boston by 7:00. She also went on to say \"next time call us as soon as you see there is a problem as this would have given us more time\". I explained I did, but she did not care. I also told the gate agent that USAIr had a flight to Providence that landed at 5:00, which would have suited my needs and he said he does not have the authority to put me on that. I mentioned this to the supervisor and she said that he would be the only one allowed to do that. She then said she would process my refund for the flight. Thsi is when I explained all of my other expenses and she said I would have to produce receipts for that, I explained t hat was not a problem as I have all of that. She then said she scould not do that but would send an email on my behalf, which she did. I also called the corporate customer service phone number where you cannot get a live person and left a voicemail requesting a call back. So while I am waiting on a call back today, instead I get an email that there was a $100 credit issued for future Jet Blue travel. I dis not ask for a standard template email or for a $100 credit. I want what I lost due to your comapny's neglegance. I am able to produce receipts for everything that I lost. I am in Senior Management for a large company in the travel industry and I know better than anyone mistakes can be costly, but at the end of the day the company needs to stand up and do what is right. In addition, when I received this email, I replied stating that this was unacceptable and I wanted a phone call to speak to somebody as that would be the professional thing to do. The response I recieved was the following: Dear Adam, Although you may not be completely satisfied with our attempt to resolve this problem for you, we feel that in fairness to all parties this is a satisfactory solution. We have answered your questions to the best of our ability and trust this will be our final correspondence regarding this issue. Sincerely, Stephanie Interline and Distribution Support JetBlue Airways Crewmember 01446 Is that a thret that I am not allowed to continue to pursue what is right?

This was not an act of god or the weather.

I can't say I want/need the Amex, but it's nice they have the option.* They let you check a bag for free!!

He didn't even try and get it for us. \u00a0I had a surgically repaired knee and had to carry our carry ons and my one year old almost half a mile, stand in immigration with her and all the way to baggage claim. \u00a0To top it off, some passengers upon departure started a fight, and were cursing expletives and threatening to punch each other on top of their lungs. \u00a0The crew members stood around while us passengers had to tell them to shutup because we had kids that were listening. \u00a030 MINUTES LATER a crew member comes and tells them the captain said they will be kicked out if they don't stop it, so they were quiet. another 30 minutes later, after nothing was said between them anymore, the captain comes out and asks one party to leave the plane. they were not even the ones who started the fight, and the party that started it and was cursing the most was allowed to stay on the plane and fly. ridiculous, I never had such a bad experience and will never fly JB again."}, {"date": "6/3/2014", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "Aside from the clean planes, roomy seats, great snacks, friendliness of everyone, free TV with lots of channels and wide assortment of music (isn't that enough?), JetBlue is the only airline that knows how to board a plane. You'd think that after 60 some-odd years of flying, American, United and Delta would know how to do it. But unless you're sitting in First or are a platinum flyer (the only people the legacy carriers actually care about), getting on one of their flights is worse than boarding a NYC subway car in rush hour. While a total waste of space and a silly attempt at recreating the past glamour of flying, American thinks it's being classy by having a two-lane gate entry (note to the idiots in the Dallas headquarters: if the premium, first-class, etc. folks are boarding first, why do they need a special lane? Let them go first through a wider passageway and then board the rest of us in steerage). At JetBlue there's no boarding by complicated formulas. Except for the few extra room seats, Jet Blue boards the back first --the simplest and most logical way to do it. \u00a0Once you're in the plane, the flight attendants actually help load the overheads and get people seated. Everyone's happy and the process is at least 10 to 15 minutes faster than the other airlines where the flight attendants are huddled in the back and little old ladies struggle with their suitcases unless some kind passenger offers to help. (After they've finished getting the $12 snack packages in order in the galley, the American/United/Delta flight attendants then usually berate passengers for taking so long to get settled and delaying the take-off). Of course, JetBlue doesn't fly everywhere, which means one can't avoid flying on the sardine cans. But whenever there's a choice, choose JetBlue."}, {"date": "11/30/2011", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "Their hanger is top notch, their planes are roomy, they just need to get with the program and get wifi on their planes."}, {"date": "9/11/2009", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "I love flying JetBlue! \u00a0(Most) Flight Attendants are really nice. \u00a0The flights are generally on time, when weather isn't a factor.
